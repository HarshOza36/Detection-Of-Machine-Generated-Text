0,"for computer enthusiast, MaxPC is a welcome sight in your mailbox. i can remember for years savorying every page of ""boot"" (as it was called",0
1,Thank god this is not a Ziff Davis publication. MaxPC will actually tell you if a product is bad.,0
2,"Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare",0
3,This beautiful magazine is in itself a work of art. The quality of every page and bits of information is fascinating.,0
4,A great read every issue.,0
5,This magazine was great for the times but as with all other technology magazines the new stuff isn't as good a lot of advertisments and reviews seem biased.,0
6,I've read Maximum PC (MPC) for many years. The articles in it are not too technical and are written with light humor.,0
7,We ordered this magazine for our grandson (then 7 going on 30) who was/is deploy into technology. He really enjoyed every issue.,0
8,I have subscribed to the nook version for a few years now and thoroughly enjoy this magazine. It has enough tech and what's new to keep me happy.,0
9,"I'm old, and so is my computer. Any advice that can help me maximize my computer perfomance is very welcome.",0
10,"At one time, this was my least favorite computer magazine. As more and more computer magazines discontinued the print editions (which i prefer), this and one other remained.",0
11,"I didn't receive a full year.  I only receive the magazine twice.  It's a good magazine, I just didn't receive it as promised.",0
12,"It was inexpensive, but now I'm getting it as an e-subscription. Would have kept it if it had stayed at $5 - hey, can't hope that a good thing will last.",0
13,These periodicals keep me up to date on everything from Foreign Affairs to Fashion to IT. I Gotta know whatup.,0
14,So helpful.  A great way to educate yourself on all things PC.  Always includes helpful artilcles about how best to make your PC better.,0

16,"My husband likes this magaize alot.  It lets him know what is new out there, for when he builds a new pc.",0
17,I love this magazine. I like the different articles they have and the reviews help guide my purchases.,0
18,I am getting sick and tired of seeing the next issue on news stands before it hits my home. Loyal members should have it fresh off the press.,0
19,I can recommend Maximum PC for computer user/builder (who's not?). Once I got it I still keep my subscription.,0
20,"I was hoping for more technical than what was there. it seems to be more like ""look how cool this is"" than a technical publication.",0
21,Been reading this magazine for years and have built 3 computers for myself over the last 5 years using product reviews and advice given by the writers of this magazine.,0
22,A must have magazine for anyone into windows computers and do it yourself computer building (the real way to do it ;)),0
23,I am incredibly happy with this product. It is exactly as I expected. I was not disappointed in the least.,0
24,I am a little disappointed I am unable to purchase Maximun PC. The magazine is still being published monthly so I have no idea why amazon will not sell it.,0

26,"I know for the most part magazines are dead, but I still like to hold one in my hand at times.",0
27,I only received one copy of the mag so I couldn't really find out if it was good reading or not,0
28,"I have subscribed off and on since 2006. Great articles, accurate reviews, hilarious editorials...very informative and always a great read.",0
29,This magazine is just ok. I ended up subscribing to pc world instead. They are more for the technician and not just the cusumer.,0

44,"I started off in the early days with a ""Boot"" subscription that eventually morphed itself into Maximum PC.",0
45,"I've built a number of PCs, so the basics are of no use to me, but I like articles that don't use too much jargon",0

52,"I just recently got into ""real"" computers, something powerful enough to run todays demanding games. MaximumPC is the perfect magazine for hardware that is above",0
53,These are something like 8 bucks per issue in stores and about a dollar per if you subscribe. I consider it a must have to keep up with the computer world.,0
54,The place for geeks. I have subscribed for many years. This is a very well written magazine with much eye appeal.,0
55,I have only been getting this magazine for three months and my computer knowledge has skyrocketed.,0

62,"This magazine is great. Im still getting them in the mail,and its great",0

74,i bought this magazine subscription for my husband and to support lymphoma research.,0
75,There are a whole slew of men's interests magazines. There are the industry standards like Esquire (quite possibly the best magazine out there) and GQ.,0
76,I was a big fan of Details my freshmen year in college...until new editors came in and changed the format of the magazine I loved.,0
77,"Details is best described as more intellectual than Maxim (and it's 20+ clones), but not as pretentions or materialistic as GQ and company.",0
78,"If you like how-to's, reviews that really count, answers to questions, and all that's happening and new in computer land: get this mag!",0

84,"i used to subscribe to pc gamer but i cant find it anywhere these days, i guess it got pulled from production...",0
85,"I got this as a Deal of the Day, without having opened an issue in a decade or more. This is the same mag in name only.",0
86,I received two issues already as promised in excellent condition so far. I like the articles. They are always reviewing the latest greatest electronic products and I like the PC tips.,0
87,Excellent product! I love reading through the magazine and learning about the cool new products out there and the cool programs!,0
88,"I ordered this hoping to learn more about the latest gadgets, and I did learn some things but in over my head over all.",0

178,Everything about the purchase made was perfect . Everything was very inspiring and lifted me. A product that must be bought!,0
179,"DETAILS is the best men's magazine bar none. Nothing comes close. GQ, even though it's from the same publisher, seems more geared towards older folks.",0

2029,This magazine is probably good for children or people who don't want to get into details. It's more like a quick browse of things an adult probably already knows.,0

2042,I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab. Why has the publisher intentionally not made this available to Android devices? This has to be a losing strategy,0

2044,Didn't have,0

2078,I love Men's Health. I have been reading it for years. So when I discovered I can read it on my Kindle Fire I was,0
2079,All I need to say is that This publishing company has poor customer service. They will only tell you how it is and will not attempt to really help you.,0
2080,To much advertisement print is yought to read and subject matter is juvenille I will not be ordering next time,0

3276,If your look for a magazine with critical thinking this would be one to get.,0
3277,Please avoid Reason. The good work they do is negated by their betrayals and attacks on others in the Liberty movement. Reason needs to fire their senior editors.,0
3278,"""The Kindle Edition of Reason contains most articles found in the print edition, but will not include all the images."" Most articles? I can understand",0

3294,"Great!  I enjoyed reading all of the tips, recipes, etc...  Can't wait til the next one comes in the mail!!!",0
3295,"This is not the Better Homes my mom subscribes to.  Not by far. Fancy photos, good color suggestions, but all too  impractical.",0
3296,"Love this mag .Love the room deco, the patio furniture the food display. If you like DIY there are lots in this mag.",0
3297,I like to download the room decorating and recipe photos so that I can take the tablet with me when I am shopping for supplies and ingredients.,0

3309,My son enjoyed for several years.,0

3316,"The perfect magazine for any science lover.
Every issue is great.",0
3317,Good light reading!,0
3318,"I love the magazine, but there are too many advertisements. I would rather pay more for the magazine to have more articles and less advertisements.",0
3319,"Finally I found a Libertarian magazine! Good and in-depth analysis in every article, too bad it appears only once a month.",0
3320,"The main menu is clear and easy, split screen with sections on the left and details for each section selected on the right of the screen.",0
3321,"First some people knock this as biased, well its written from a libertarian stand point. The articles are thoughtful, provocative, and always point towards a personal freedom and limited government.",0
3322,I was looking for a magazine for my kindle with a more conservative take on the news. Most magazines offered here are very liberal/left leaning.,0
3323,I was once a subscriber to Reason. Unfortunately under the current editor it has taken a sharp turn in the wrong direction.,0
3324,"Initially, I liked this publication for it's candid exploration of current marijuana laws and the media hype on prescription drugs.",0
3325,When I first tried the Kindle version this past January (2010) I was a bit disappointed because although the fine articles found in the newsstand,0
3326,I thought I'd try this magazine based on the title Reason.,0
3327,I got the November 2010 copy of Reason and was annoyed to find that the article I knew something about were all biased.,0
3328,"With all of the garbage journalism out there, and the political money-mongering, it's refreshing to read a magazine that is chock full of good solid",0

3332,Enjoy every issue and use the decorating tips and love trying out the various recipes.  Have not been disappointed in the magazine.,0
3333,I subscribed before and stopped because I didn't have time to read it.  Now I have the time.  Glad this offer came along,0
3334,"I love the tons of ideas they give you especially as I so not have a ""Creativity"" bone in my body!!",0

3338,This is a terrific magazine to thumb through on a lazy day. I like the feel of the print between my fingers and so watch,0
3339,Great magazine!,0
3340,Mostly advertisements for rich people and the rest is liberal.,0
3341,This magazine is nothing but advertisements. I have never heard of some of the local restaurants reviewed and I do not agree with the ones,0
3342,I thought I would like it but I don't. It's basically an 100 page advertorial with a few mediocre articles about even less mediocre Texans.,0
3343,"great buy, thanks",0
3344,Really enjoy this magazine!!!,0
3345,Cannot live without Texas Monthly!,0
3346,Too many ads. I feel like this is nothing but a magazine for marketing. Seems like over half the pages were ads for realtors or doctors.,0

3348,I really enjoy reading about events in the area. The articles are relevant and touching. My husband and I both enjoy reading it.,0

3350,I love this mag. Every DIYer should have a sub.,0
3351,"My husband loves, loves, loves this magazine. Actually, I find myself flipping through it as well.",0
3352,disclaimer - I am not much of a handyman but I like this magazine.  Lots of nice tips and articles.,0
3353,Don't ever order this magazine. The low subscription price is a ploy to get you on their mailing list to mail you books you did,0
3354,Some cool projects for the beginner wood worker.,0
3355,my husband still enjoys it,0
3356,This is a great step-by-step guide to any handyman. Good projects.,0
3357,A favorite!,0
3358,should have suscribed before now,0
3359,This is a great magazine for understanding the Libertarian point of view. I don't agree with everything; the drug legalization stuff is a tough read.,0
3360,I tried a few issues of Reason to change up my usual reading list. I wanted something with quality reporting that presented the facts and was light on opinion.,0
3361,"Very iconoclastic, with its refusal to accept the idea that all good flows from, and all problems can (and should be) solved by government.",0
3362,"This is by far my favorite news/politics magazine. I don't agree with everything in any issue but I always find something that makes me think,",0
3363,"I purchased one issue of REASON to evaluate the magazine. While the articles were varied and well written, the lack of a table of contents was quite frustrating.",0
3364,This is a very interesting magazine that makes a great addition to anyone's Kindle library.,0
3365,"Edited to say apparently this is no longer True. ******************************** Thus far my subscription to kindle comes about a week after the print mag comes out, sometimes even after that.",0
3366,"Like so much of the frothy-mouthed twaddle that partisans (of all stripes) peddle as The Truth, this magazine belies its self-blindness in its very name; ""Reason"".",0
3367,"I'm moderately libertarian, so I usually agree with the views expressed in Reason. I enjoy poring over the news summaries and the book reviews, then skimming the articles.",0
3368,Reason's articles are more than just libertarian-biased reporting of and commentary on the news.,0
3369,Not much to it anymore.  Not like I remember,0
3370,Just canceled auto renewal and decided to post the reason as a review... The last issue was so thin they couldn't even print on the spine (e.g.,0
3371,Just as the title says.,0
3372,"This magazine has some interesting things in it, but each issue is very, very short/small... there isn't much to it.",0
3373,Always fun and a great magazine.,0
3374,for my grand sons,0
3375,Still a great publication,0
3376,I love it!,0

3386,"Good magazine, it gives you lots of tips and ideas.",0
3387,Very good resource,0
3388,What can I say?  I love this magazine.  Full of lots of information for any handyman ... you do not have to be an expert.,0
3389,"Wow - you can't beat a deal like this. A full year practically free. There was an option to receive the download version too, but",0
3390,Absolutely love Better Home and Gardens magazine and some of their other specialty publications - enjoy wonderful recipes and interior decorating ideas.,0

3398,"The price was a good value, however, it takes forever for the first issue to come. So if you order for a gift be sure",0
3399,Reason is one of my favorite magazines. It offers a (libertarian) perspective that you don't find in many publications.,0
3400,Reason is a good magazine for your smart friends.  It makes you think and it is actually very well written.,0
3401,I let my subscription lapse a few years ago. Unread issues just kept piling up because the magazine had gotten consistently dull.,0
3402,I just started getting Reason in the mail and have to agree that it is significantly superior to merely downloading the articles online.,0
3403,"I used to read the online content for this magazine (I still check out the blog), but I have to say that there is even",0
3404,There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days.,0
3405,"This monthly magazine is an opinionated breath of fresh air. It's philosophically allied with Libertarianism, but it is not extreme or strident.",0
3406,"Being a moderate libertarian with a penchant for pragmatic politics and a subscriber to several magazines, I would think that i'm in the very core of their target audience.",0
3407,"For this registered Libertarian, this is a pretty good magazine. Decent articles that are written well and easy to read, as well as being informative.",0
3408,"Mr. Hayek apparently despises free thought. Furthermore, his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate.",0
3409,I have really enjoyed getting Texas Monthly. My family and I have already been able to plan two getaways we can afford. Thank you,0
3410,The print is SO SMALL it is hard to enjoy.,0
3411,"As a Texas expat living in NY, I look forward to the arrival every month!  I especially love the indepth articles written by Skip Hollingsworth.",0
3412,"I find Texas Monthly very interesting. I have not got my first copy yet, have been reading copy floating around my apartment house.",0
3413,"They haven't found a conservative they like yet
But if you skip those articles not a bad read",0
3414,"Liberal slant (expected) but I must admit that the writing is outstanding and, hell, it's all about Texas!!!! Well, except for all the ads for touring New Mexico, Colorado, Jokelahoma.....",0

3465,I used to subscribe to well over 16 Magazine Publications I trimmed back to only subscribing to 3 in the last 3 years well this one I added recently.,0
3466,I'm a consummate world traveler but have to be budget minded. This magazine seems more tailored for the wealthier travelers of the world and doesn't necessarily suit my needs.,0
3467,CN Traveler is a good mass-market travel magazine.,0
3468,"It has everything. Interesting reviews by pro and ""joes"". Good advice and recommendations. Worth every dollar. Great way to learn about new destinations and missed jems for the next time.",0
