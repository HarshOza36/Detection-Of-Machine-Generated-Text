the sideline for it to say theyre worried about well no he did it the hard way and that he knew he was near the,0
sideline and he dragged both feet as he went across to catch the ball but apparently the official who was right there saw his feet,0
on their chalk mark fourth and five and now in confirmation of jim norton who finished second in the league in funding he averaged 43,0
yards of kick pains and jackson jackson s closer to you after haynes on the far side and the double safety theyre on their own,0

they split three and three dallas is the only club in the american football league to stay even with euston in season series over the,0
first three years of the lead second and seven awesome fading for the 43rd i think in this case it had to go along with,0
the official that was a little late but this what s behind all that is that those quarter backs everybody s gone infarct you can,0
get that big man out of there weve got the game half won i mean legally and he tried to bail him hard dallas first,0
down on the houston 44g 15 our family so far in the game here the signal roughly read born moving in let us say this,0
is a first in a series of these and were going to see a little delay dallas leading 10 to nothing 11 and a half,0
minutes to play in the first half dallas had the first down on the houston 44 there s a faker mcclinton rocking last in the,0
50 45 40 and he goes to the 34 boston has been a depth all year at getting out of the pocket of rushing linemen,0
and picking up yardage he s not overly fast but he s clever picking his way up field doug playing hit him first to slow,0

the last week that he will tell you about some of the great college names in the country third down nine to go houston on,0
their 32 lander intercepted by number 45 dave jason s at the 40 35 30 and down grayson for my ward and dallas now house,0
of all in history territory on the houston twenty nine and bland is going to be kicking himself there there s a man who intercepted,0
grayson in that you saw him stop there and sort of confer with hennigan out on the flanker there was apparently a little bit of,0
a mixup and generally a quarterback a call time out there but he went ahead with the play and that s what usually results when,0
there s a little bit of a misunderstanding in the huddle theyve got frank jackson as a flanker back theyve gone out of there to,0
fullback system give it them a clinton what a hole and open for him is he roars for the twenty three favre carroll and jim,0
tyre were blocking for curtis mcclinton second down four to go for dallas only houston 23 dallas of the head ten to nothing we have,0
six and a half minutes to play in the first half jackson s the flanking back the ends in sight mr haynes pains a shot,0
at the 25 theyll be fenian on abner haynes all day he averaged nearly five yards to carry this pass see he s a marked,0
man every time he gets the ball mike dukes it him first and then head husband came in the home loss to three third down,0
and seven to go there s the dallas bench in there coach hank stram heard gaudium fall chris froome with jack buck again in houston,0
texas dallas leading 17 nothing as houston puts the ball in play on their 49 george blanda tackled by johnny robinson and he plowed the,0
tight end from abilene christian that gives a first down for houston on the dallas 30 he s had pretty good luck on his patterns,0
down the middle all day curt hennig and dropped the last one but he was wide open so planta obviously is sticking with what is,0
the best spot to throw in up to now now houston asking for time as they came up and once again he had a mix,0
up in the huddle there apparently bland and hennigan are not hitting on all six on these past patterns so he called a timeout so,0
he they didnt blow this better than this time bobby ply on the dallas bench number 20 bobby hunt of auburn now branch is 87,0
ready to go now houston ball first down on the dallas 30 landed a cannon at the 30 and out of bounds on the 26,0
yard line dave grace in the right corner man took him out ron zillow was leading the way around the block put it on a,0
27 they say second down and seven houston is not on the scoreboard yet theyre trailing 17 nothing with two minutes 46 seconds to go,0
in the first half and again the plank arrived with two slots back color and motion color on the inside reversed goes to the 24,0
of dallas number 72 is paul rochester and number 75 is gary maze theyre the two big men in the middle of that dallas line,0
they have a third down and five to go houston in possession when they have just 2 minutes and 20 seconds left in the first,0
half to get a score there s the kipling 3 or the collet and complete passive tenant for hennigan you notice every time hennigan cos,0
downfall is being doubleteaming yes they have to cover him that way he has all the moves as i mentioned he s not having a,0
good day with his hands he dropped two passes he should have had i will say this in his favor both passes are a little,0
bit behind the mark but this should be no excuse for a good receiver like hanigan he just one of those things sometimes you drop,0
him and he dropped 2 of 5 and 1/4 pound fourth and five on the dallas 25 a big one for blanda having trouble hanging,0
on to the bolivar good wall with the intended receiver number 88 well houston swept the straw here late in the first half that stop,0
and dallas takes over a first down for dallas on the dallas 25 with dallas out in front 17 to nothing the lack of being,0
able to hold on to the ball has killed two drives for houston up to now and this this of course really changes the quarterbacks,0
thinking because he expects to make that game when a man is open he chose to him when he doesnt youve just seen two drives,0
go to pot theyve got their backfield now jackson on the flank mcclinton haynes deep dawson faking the draw throwing the haines at the 25,0
ever haynes at the 30 and haynes is brought down at the 33 yard line of dallas by doug klein and mike dukes the two,0
linebackers of the houston oilers their twominute warning now is being given to each been a gain of eight for abner haynes second down two,0
to go for the dallas texans are out in front 17 to nothing jackson is the flanker left both have been tight avril haines trying,0
to get outside he stopped with a 34 yard line by bucky wagoner and freddie glick and those victorious missourians are sitting here watching their,0
old teammate bucky wagner who played at missouri just a year ago third down one to go for dallas on the dallas 34 jack spikes,0
down at fullback replacing curtis mcclinton jaxson the flanker theyve got the first down and more filling up to the 39yard line as jack spikes,0
mike dukes brought him down jack spikes of texas christian i wanted if dawson was gonna sit on that 17 point leader go for the,0
throw here and try to get another quick test down before the half and he is throwing but he s throwing the safe type pass,0
all youve seen so far is the screen which is the type of thing that is seldom intercepted let s see if he throws downfield,0
now or just plays it cozy the rest of the half all right paul theyre 45 seconds to go in the half dawson right down,0
the middle and it is complete to spread our banners number 84 the tight end his second year from michigan state university that was quite,0
a catch by him mike dukes haul him in and theyre going to try and stop the clock now it s on the houston 49,0

tied up 17 17 first team of scores wins the game landed a cannon cannon gets it to the 14 second down seven sherry hedrick,0
the middle linebacker made the tackle for dallas curt i think we can pose a question for the armchair quarterbacks at home right now you,0
youre going to have a tough time getting out of this territory running but if you throw that ball an interception can be fatal what,0
are you going to do in this position second down seven houston on their 14 any kind of a field position of course can be,0
vital in this game for a field goal the women lana s quick fast complete to the 25 a 45 day bracelet there s a,0
first time for houston i have to say mr blaine has a lot of fortitude to make that call first down houston on the 25,0
the game is tied 17 17 five and a half minutes to go in the first overtime period paula smith right back to bland again,0
plaintiff pass incomplete intended for billy cannon number 20 that ball was given to smith on a draw and he gave it right back to,0
bland oh and i think we noticed something there too curt cannon was about to receive the ball again his back trouble he could not,0
bend over that ball hit him on the thigh guard it was low but he cant bend over while he s running to make that,0
catch this game right now of course this is unofficial but this is the longest game ever played in the history of brawl football here,0
it is done through nearly ten minutes of the overtime period dave smith on a draw play whipping his way up to the 29 yard,0
line third down and six to go for houston while corey on the tackle for the dallas texans each team had a vente chol season,0
records of 11 wins and three losses houston won the eastern division of the american football league and dallas the western division and each split,0
two games playing each other we had only one tie game all year that was a tie between buffalo and boston and this is the,0
second time it comes in the championship game land a little quick toss up with a snare let s get the 35 in a 36,0
they get enough for a first down he s fan sound like he made a touchdown on our okay every yard and this over time,0
ago his vital dallas giving up ground grudgingly but giving it up right now first down for youthful lana on the quick pastor kenan ban,0
him to the 40 to the 41 for yard gain for cannon tackle by aj holub the beast was been the beast today second down,0
and six to go for houston on the houston 41 the game tied 17 17 three minutes and 35 seconds left in this overtime period,0
still neither team has scored in the seventh period did they go through their first period let s start the second one and keep playing,0
though somebody s called doublewing set up land at the hennigan complete at the 15 pentagon first time very fish is what three above right,0
in his lap and when he caught out of his ear by the way we have a light rain coming down now just a light,0
one but if it continues enough to perhaps make the field a little slippery and the ball too first down for houston on a 50yard,0
line were tied 17 to 17 in the overtime period houston has marched in at the living yard line to the 50 yard line on,0
this drive land of faking firing or somebody there pass intended for canon who had turned in going out and then in atlanta was throwing,0
to the sidelines here again you see the difference now and between dawson and blanda we have not seen duss and there s your time,0
right there we have not seen dawson throw a ball away today and that time we did see bland to throw one away because he,0
was going to lose about 12 yards if hed hell it there was a blue jersey in the area so he could throw to it,0
but actually throwing the ball away to save that 15 yards dawson depends on his own running to get out of that hole and very,0
often he does consequently he has over a six hundred percentage in passing houston s second down on the 50yard line second and 10 double,0
wing landis pass is complete they took up about 50 yard every yard for that ball for a field goal to win this game there,0
s a very first time for houston now theyre on the dollar thirty five oh what a grinding march this has been by houston 39,0
yards upfield 15 downfield they have now march 54 yards from their 11 yard line and theyve got a great field goal kicker and blander,0
the pitch today smith smith is hit hard by cheryl hedrick number 69 that was a tremendous effort by hendricks they all league linebacker on,0
the american league defensive team they lost the yard on that played a second down and 11 the goal for houston and ill tell you,0
that dallas line hasnt thrown in the towel im shouting either theyre playing hard nosed ball second down 11 this is not only the battle,0
for the american league championship isnt for the state of texas all effective second down 11 ago lander rolling out fires and the complexion suddenly,0
changes houston has marched 54yard they were giving him a little and he s unhappy right here at the bottom of your screen getting a,0
field goal range that s five intercepts an interception for dallas today and now dallas takes over on the 50 yard line with one minute,0
to play in the first overtime three i say first overtime story because when neither team scored in the last minute theyre going into the,0
second over there hall a rookie and also a basketball player at wake forest and a football in he s try to basketball player first,0
time for dallas on the 50 yard line they got their big backpack fill in again this optima clinton the clinton gets three yards to,0
the houston 47th second down and seven ago there s the time running out of this suddendeath period teams have changed goals by the way,0
at the end of the period that would give dallas the wind advantage in the second quarter houston is hard the wind in the fourth,0
period of the regulation and in the first period here of overtime so theyve made that decision stand up on the cake time is running,0
out as the curtain takes the hand off there s the end of the first overtime period theyll now change goals and start the second,0
overtime period with the first team of stores winning the game saw the score here at the end of the first suddendeath period where a,0
little football history is being made today in houston texas to score the dallas texans 17 the houston oilers 17 now ladies and gentlemen going,0
into the sixth period turn i wasnt waiting for you to say that s the end of the fifth quarter going into the third half,0
third dimes seven the goal for dallas on the houston 48 after rolling out competing at the strikes at the 45 40 bike goes down,0
on the 38 here the light rain is falling first down and it was a big play for dallas they third him seven and they,0
got a first down on it suddendeath first team of scores wins the american football league championship dallas had the first down in the houston,0
38 yard line it s been a remarkable game we havent had an injury in the game weve had very few substitutes on either the,0
offensive defensive team and both clubs are still going fulltilt weve got a lot of young football players in the both team their spikes getting,0
outside of the 35 to the 30 25 20 and such the gel sow in real scoring position at the 18 jack spike injured a,0
bad leg injury earlier that allowed ricky fitters for clinton to take his job away from him but today was burford the ace receiver a,0
flanker back on the sidelines dallas was done with two fullbacks in it back they learned they have come through curt incidentally there has not,0
been an injury or a major substitution in this ball game dallas has a first down on the houston 19 and dallas brothers saying young,0
there is 23 and a half years of age up to the line of scrimmage boston fire suspect chris and his heman he was really,0
open at the five probably could have scored at least bina kasih ball it would have been a first down and goal to go for,0
dallas thatll make a coach s heart stop thanks graham dusted then second down and ten the goal for dallas on the houston 19 in,0
the second suddendeath overtime period of course when you overrun the passer as houston did there then youre in real danger because he pops out,0
he s got that much extra time to pick an open receiver in it and if they keep running as they should do theyre bound,0
to be open somebody if you get that much time game aside 17 the 17 lenny dawson after mcclinton stop told by bill herzman while,0
still on the 19 yard line third and 10 and of course the dallas a doesnt move for the first down here theyll go for,0
the field goal that could win the game and if he doesnt throw this time hell run for position probably just right in the middle,0
of the field that a fairly good angle right now paul we need to be about 2 or 3 yards tortoise to the near sideline,0
and if you write the middle move it over three yards in one inch teams now have played more than 77 minutes a day of,0
hard bruising football areas sneaking forward getting in field goal position picked up about 3 yard the quarterback sneak exhausting the angle slightly to the,0
middle of the field to get that ball in position and now delicious field goal that will win the american league championship there on the,0
18 yard line tommy booker will attempt the field goal and i think it s pretty safe to predict about an 11 man rush by,0
houston when dawson will hole that s the ballast point dallas is calling for timeout they want to get everything set for this field goal,0
attempt that if they would make it will give them the championship and the game well while we have a moment here while in dawson,0
and his torch hank stram confer we want to remind you that im sunday january 13th many of the stars youve seen in this championship,0

big backfield in two fullbacks in right now right to the plant and they flip haynes on the wing to play number 43 and gary,0
cut singer number 80 bird i think we might as well mention right now i believe these people watching the ballgame can hear this this,0
crowd is almost to the point of hysteria before the ballgame began so you can expect a lot of delays by the quarterbacks when our,0
own players cant hear their signals today second down five to go for the dallas texans on their own 33 lenny dawson brings them up,0
blank wide left that s putting the end 35 of the 37 had moosman stop team there he is curtis mcclinton number 32 the rookie,0
of the year the american football league and a former allamerican at camden he finished hilton iligan rushing and did not play much in the,0
first four games 230 and he can move as planned most of the time throws the ball pretty much with a van and he throws,0
quite often and i think he s thrown about a third more passes than dawson this season all right george blanda number 16 the veteran,0
quarterback give the pilot charlie colors at the 45 into the 47 bob schmidt was blocking for him davis in the rochester in on the,0
stop three yard gain second down seven youll see toller s paul mentioned a very unusual running style he s only five feet six and,0

down he s quite a squirmer third down five to go for houston on their 49 theyre in their double wing set up now blanda,0
looking good protection and again with shackles by bobby slide number 14 formerly available this sound for houston when you saw him line up as,0
you did there with nobody in the offensive back field except lando theyre all out on the flanker this means he s got at least,0
five receivers to throw to because theyll all go downfield tanana toller is set deep hennigan flank left dropped the cannon trying to get outside,0
235 at the free $2600 he was brought down get hard there by aj holub talimena he was moving out the block for him now,0

255 pounds at the 12 yard line third down and 2 the goal or the houston oilers same setup with canada thrower deep they get,0
at the cannon the linebackers and then send billy cannon wide the faculty bill hall number 85 defensive left in and bobby fly number 14,0
that was it kurt that was a nice call by bland a fine call because everybody was expecting the fullback taller to hit for that,0
short yards and he faked him up the middle and drew that defense in first down goal the goal for the houston oilers on the,0
ballast section five panting wraps up on the 4 yard line by jerry mays in each a hollow jaeha lobe in his second year in,0

rig number 69 also was an allpoint the throw choice second down four to go for a houston touchdown theyre just over the dallas five,0
well call it the four we have no score eight minutes ten seconds to go in the first period plan of the canon canon knock,0
down on the nine yard line by a mad branch number 87 and by dave grace in the right corner man number 45 we really,0
fired through now it s third down and nine the goal for a houston touchdown theyre both playing is rather cautiously both quarterbacks occurred but,0
i would suspect youd almost have to see a throw now for the five yards ago and if it fails come up with a field,0
goal but theyve both stayed on the ground there s been only one pass in the ball game up to now theyre down nine to,0
go for houston theyre on the dallas nine and again goes wide right blue ball split in left planta fading on third down bacala houston,0
there goes home for the key intersection and greeted by smugly sober one of the texas lyman made a fine fighters holub right there made,0
a fine defensive play because he hit planted just as he was throwing and that was the result of that wounded pigeon throw as you,0
saw it fall down into hollis hands so dallas has the ball mister their first two first down of the game dallas on their 48th,0
first down we have no score six minutes 54 seconds left to play in the first period ames as a flanker back again the spikes,0
in mcclinton set beat two fullbacks in the dallas backfield here s mcclinton in the houston territory and out of bounds on the houston 45,0
curtis mcclinton the big rookie pull back knocked down and out by freddy glick the right safety man of houston now reynolds the right guard,0
was pulling for him and leading away there was a gain of seven if second down and three to go and for the first time,0
in the game dallas is in houston territory let s see what they do now second and three the pastor hain is completed it s,0
good at the 37 yard line well be a first down fidelis dont even feel on top of abner haynes the second leading rusher in,0
the american league first down dallas their second first down in the game but crisper firt injured dallas has changed their backfield perfer it is,0
by far the outstanding pass receiver on the dallas team so for the championship game is at two fullbacks in the lineup and put haynes,0
out on the plane first down dallas on the houston 37 cross to mcclinton at the 35 and the quickly running it inside the 30,0
out of bounds in the houston 29 culpepper drove him out number 78 of course one thing they accomplished too by using the two fullbacks,0
is the deep man in the backfield if theyre not running they have great pass protection for lenny dawson because youve got the two big,0
boys in there to block dallas grinding it out now they stop the houston touchdown threat dallas now is carried from their 43 after the,0
interception by ej holub theyre now on the houston twenty nine with a second down and two to go dawson on second down there s,0
a lot passionately he did not have control and possession it was antennae for mclaren on that tumbling attempt but it all ends up as,0
an incomplete forward pass into the third down and two to go he sure had it long enough as he was going down looked like,0
a juggling act five minutes 53 seconds to go in the first period no score panes wide left to tighten up and both ends in,0
price the fake to mcclinton dec fights off mike duke sarah winning and that was a great class slides awesome he had a leading purposely,0
and drop it here s your signal motion declined by houston dallas loses it down in his fourth and three for dallas on the houston,0

i have them attempt a field goal it s no difference from that distance it would give another opportunity to throw all right tommy butcher,0
will attempt the kick holding his gospel he spotted on the 15 yard line wide angle from the far side and the kick the store,0
jefferson city in the dallas section 3 of the houston oilers nothing tommy booker who just looted that field goal to put dallas in front,0

of all in history territory on the houston twenty nine and bland is going to be kicking himself there there s a man who intercepted,0
grayson in that you saw him stop there and sort of confer with hennigan out on the flanker there was apparently a little bit of,0
a mixup and generally a quarterback a call time out there but he went ahead with the play and that s what usually results when,0
there s a little bit of a misunderstanding in the huddle theyve got frank jackson as a flanker back theyve gone out of there to,0
fullback system give it them a clinton what a hole and open for him is he roars for the twenty three favre carroll and jim,0
tyre were blocking for curtis mcclinton second down four to go for dallas only houston 23 dallas of the head ten to nothing we have,0
six and a half minutes to play in the first half jackson s the flanking back the ends in sight mr haynes pains a shot,0
at the 25 theyll be fenian on abner haynes all day he averaged nearly five yards to carry this pass see he s a marked,0
man every time he gets the ball mike dukes it him first and then head husband came in the home loss to three third down,0
and seven to go there s the dallas bench in there coach hank stram heard gaudium fall chris froome with jack buck again in houston,0
texas dallas leading 17 nothing as houston puts the ball in play on their 49 george blanda tackled by johnny robinson and he plowed the,0
tight end from abilene christian that gives a first down for houston on the dallas 30 he s had pretty good luck on his patterns,0
down the middle all day curt hennig and dropped the last one but he was wide open so planta obviously is sticking with what is,0
the best spot to throw in up to now now houston asking for time as they came up and once again he had a mix,0
up in the huddle there apparently bland and hennigan are not hitting on all six on these past patterns so he called a timeout so,0
he they didnt blow this better than this time bobby ply on the dallas bench number 20 bobby hunt of auburn now branch is 87,0
ready to go now houston ball first down on the dallas 30 landed a cannon at the 30 and out of bounds on the 26,0
yard line dave grace in the right corner man took him out ron zillow was leading the way around the block put it on a,0
27 they say second down and seven houston is not on the scoreboard yet theyre trailing 17 nothing with two minutes 46 seconds to go,0
in the first half and again the plank arrived with two slots back color and motion color on the inside reversed goes to the 24,0
of dallas number 72 is paul rochester and number 75 is gary maze theyre the two big men in the middle of that dallas line,0
they have a third down and five to go houston in possession when they have just 2 minutes and 20 seconds left in the first,0
half to get a score there s the kipling 3 or the collet and complete passive tenant for hennigan you notice every time hennigan cos,0
downfall is being doubleteaming yes they have to cover him that way he has all the moves as i mentioned he s not having a,0
good day with his hands he dropped two passes he should have had i will say this in his favor both passes are a little,0
bit behind the mark but this should be no excuse for a good receiver like hanigan he just one of those things sometimes you drop,0
him and he dropped 2 of 5 and 1/4 pound fourth and five on the dallas 25 a big one for blanda having trouble hanging,0
on to the bolivar good wall with the intended receiver number 88 well houston swept the straw here late in the first half that stop,0
and dallas takes over a first down for dallas on the dallas 25 with dallas out in front 17 to nothing the lack of being,0
able to hold on to the ball has killed two drives for houston up to now and this this of course really changes the quarterbacks,0
thinking because he expects to make that game when a man is open he chose to him when he doesnt youve just seen two drives,0
go to pot theyve got their backfield now jackson on the flank mcclinton haynes deep dawson faking the draw throwing the haines at the 25,0
ever haynes at the 30 and haynes is brought down at the 33 yard line of dallas by doug klein and mike dukes the two,0
linebackers of the houston oilers their twominute warning now is being given to each been a gain of eight for abner haynes second down two,0
to go for the dallas texans are out in front 17 to nothing jackson is the flanker left both have been tight avril haines trying,0
to get outside he stopped with a 34 yard line by bucky wagoner and freddie glick and those victorious missourians are sitting here watching their,0
old teammate bucky wagner who played at missouri just a year ago third down one to go for dallas on the dallas 34 jack spikes,0
down at fullback replacing curtis mcclinton jaxson the flanker theyve got the first down and more filling up to the 39yard line as jack spikes,0
mike dukes brought him down jack spikes of texas christian i wanted if dawson was gonna sit on that 17 point leader go for the,0
throw here and try to get another quick test down before the half and he is throwing but he s throwing the safe type pass,0
all youve seen so far is the screen which is the type of thing that is seldom intercepted let s see if he throws downfield,0
now or just plays it cozy the rest of the half all right paul theyre 45 seconds to go in the half dawson right down,0
the middle and it is complete to spread our banners number 84 the tight end his second year from michigan state university that was quite,0

back of the flim safety confirmation is jim norton whose average 42 yards of booth martin is angling for the near coffin corner it s,0
a beautiful kick jackson takes it on the sick his motion stopped just short of the five as hart and his beautiful spiral may live,0

brought him down very close to the first down and they have the measurement the clinton has been a ball today rushing into that line,0
there is a measurement any part of the ball meeting the inside edge of the yard step first time credit that dallas line was some,0
really great blogging in here i often mention the toughest 10 yards of football the last 10 to the goal line but this is the,0
second toughest 10 down in your own territory because the defense knows you probably wont throw and they like they load up that defensive line,0
"and you really have to root them out to make yardage down here first down dallas under 15,000 13 youre firing deep spike spike number",0
30 was out in the open he was covered two steps behind by bobbie gentry as dawson throws those secondary men with that fake ball,0
he does real welland and incidentally a fine call there he finally got out far enough where he figured he had enough air to get,0
back in throwable dallas texans in the lead 17 to 7 had the ball on their 15yard line second down 10 ranked jacksonville flanking back,0
pains a mcclinton er set deep brought the haines at the 15 20 25 same rut bouncing behind by doug klein at the gain of,0
14 and gives alice another first down there now there you see something that dawson accomplished even with an incomplete pass he shook up that,0
defense a little bit they had to get away from that heavy line down here it went back to a normal defensive line and then,0
he can pop through with that running play dallas has moved this ball from their fiveyard line of the 29 theyre much better operating in,0
field position now they were a few moments ago dawson taking and 78 is at salt pepper boring in the bringing down but he caught,0
his spikes back on the 19 the loss of 10 it is second down and 20 for dallas dark the clock again says leslie born,0
dallas by the way sticking to the clock has been eating it up here and throwing the ball in the last minutes of the third,0
period and with a tenpoint lead the best defense right now is to keep that ball as they come up they have a second down,0
and 20 jackson the flanker wide left pasta hey let s see who gets up in the body if that husband number 82 pain thermal,0

to belt each other or not having a little idea coming up on that then they both suddenly decided neither one wanted a 15yard penalty,0
at this stage of the game so they quieted down where s chris burford the allamerican will former in the stanford and the outstanding the,0

tied up 17 17 first team of scores wins the game landed a cannon cannon gets it to the 14 second down seven sherry hedrick,0
the middle linebacker made the tackle for dallas curt i think we can pose a question for the armchair quarterbacks at home right now you,0
youre going to have a tough time getting out of this territory running but if you throw that ball an interception can be fatal what,0
are you going to do in this position second down seven houston on their 14 any kind of a field position of course can be,0
vital in this game for a field goal the women lana s quick fast complete to the 25 a 45 day bracelet there s a,0
first time for houston i have to say mr blaine has a lot of fortitude to make that call first down houston on the 25,0
the game is tied 17 17 five and a half minutes to go in the first overtime period paula smith right back to bland again,0
plaintiff pass incomplete intended for billy cannon number 20 that ball was given to smith on a draw and he gave it right back to,0
bland oh and i think we noticed something there too curt cannon was about to receive the ball again his back trouble he could not,0
bend over that ball hit him on the thigh guard it was low but he cant bend over while he s running to make that,0
catch this game right now of course this is unofficial but this is the longest game ever played in the history of brawl football here,0
it is done through nearly ten minutes of the overtime period dave smith on a draw play whipping his way up to the 29 yard,0
line third down and six to go for houston while corey on the tackle for the dallas texans each team had a vente chol season,0
records of 11 wins and three losses houston won the eastern division of the american football league and dallas the western division and each split,0
two games playing each other we had only one tie game all year that was a tie between buffalo and boston and this is the,0
second time it comes in the championship game land a little quick toss up with a snare let s get the 35 in a 36,0
they get enough for a first down he s fan sound like he made a touchdown on our okay every yard and this over time,0
ago his vital dallas giving up ground grudgingly but giving it up right now first down for youthful lana on the quick pastor kenan ban,0
him to the 40 to the 41 for yard gain for cannon tackle by aj holub the beast was been the beast today second down,0
and six to go for houston on the houston 41 the game tied 17 17 three minutes and 35 seconds left in this overtime period,0
still neither team has scored in the seventh period did they go through their first period let s start the second one and keep playing,0
though somebody s called doublewing set up land at the hennigan complete at the 15 pentagon first time very fish is what three above right,0
in his lap and when he caught out of his ear by the way we have a light rain coming down now just a light,0
one but if it continues enough to perhaps make the field a little slippery and the ball too first down for houston on a 50yard,0
line were tied 17 to 17 in the overtime period houston has marched in at the living yard line to the 50 yard line on,0
this drive land of faking firing or somebody there pass intended for canon who had turned in going out and then in atlanta was throwing,0
to the sidelines here again you see the difference now and between dawson and blanda we have not seen duss and there s your time,0
right there we have not seen dawson throw a ball away today and that time we did see bland to throw one away because he,0
was going to lose about 12 yards if hed hell it there was a blue jersey in the area so he could throw to it,0
but actually throwing the ball away to save that 15 yards dawson depends on his own running to get out of that hole and very,0
often he does consequently he has over a six hundred percentage in passing houston s second down on the 50yard line second and 10 double,0
wing landis pass is complete they took up about 50 yard every yard for that ball for a field goal to win this game there,0
s a very first time for houston now theyre on the dollar thirty five oh what a grinding march this has been by houston 39,0
yards upfield 15 downfield they have now march 54 yards from their 11 yard line and theyve got a great field goal kicker and blander,0
the pitch today smith smith is hit hard by cheryl hedrick number 69 that was a tremendous effort by hendricks they all league linebacker on,0
the american league defensive team they lost the yard on that played a second down and 11 the goal for houston and ill tell you,0
that dallas line hasnt thrown in the towel im shouting either theyre playing hard nosed ball second down 11 this is not only the battle,0
for the american league championship isnt for the state of texas all effective second down 11 ago lander rolling out fires and the complexion suddenly,0
changes houston has marched 54yard they were giving him a little and he s unhappy right here at the bottom of your screen getting a,0
field goal range that s five intercepts an interception for dallas today and now dallas takes over on the 50 yard line with one minute,0
to play in the first overtime three i say first overtime story because when neither team scored in the last minute theyre going into the,0
second over there hall a rookie and also a basketball player at wake forest and a football in he s try to basketball player first,0
time for dallas on the 50 yard line they got their big backpack fill in again this optima clinton the clinton gets three yards to,0
the houston 47th second down and seven ago there s the time running out of this suddendeath period teams have changed goals by the way,0
at the end of the period that would give dallas the wind advantage in the second quarter houston is hard the wind in the fourth,0
period of the regulation and in the first period here of overtime so theyve made that decision stand up on the cake time is running,0
out as the curtain takes the hand off there s the end of the first overtime period theyll now change goals and start the second,0
overtime period with the first team of stores winning the game saw the score here at the end of the first suddendeath period where a,0

38 yard line it s been a remarkable game we havent had an injury in the game weve had very few substitutes on either the,0
offensive defensive team and both clubs are still going fulltilt weve got a lot of young football players in the both team their spikes getting,0
outside of the 35 to the 30 25 20 and such the gel sow in real scoring position at the 18 jack spike injured a,0
bad leg injury earlier that allowed ricky fitters for clinton to take his job away from him but today was burford the ace receiver a,0
flanker back on the sidelines dallas was done with two fullbacks in it back they learned they have come through curt incidentally there has not,0
been an injury or a major substitution in this ball game dallas has a first down on the houston 19 and dallas brothers saying young,0
there is 23 and a half years of age up to the line of scrimmage boston fire suspect chris and his heman he was really,0
open at the five probably could have scored at least bina kasih ball it would have been a first down and goal to go for,0
dallas thatll make a coach s heart stop thanks graham dusted then second down and ten the goal for dallas on the houston 19 in,0
the second suddendeath overtime period of course when you overrun the passer as houston did there then youre in real danger because he pops out,0
he s got that much extra time to pick an open receiver in it and if they keep running as they should do theyre bound,0
to be open somebody if you get that much time game aside 17 the 17 lenny dawson after mcclinton stop told by bill herzman while,0
still on the 19 yard line third and 10 and of course the dallas a doesnt move for the first down here theyll go for,0
the field goal that could win the game and if he doesnt throw this time hell run for position probably just right in the middle,0
of the field that a fairly good angle right now paul we need to be about 2 or 3 yards tortoise to the near sideline,0
and if you write the middle move it over three yards in one inch teams now have played more than 77 minutes a day of,0
hard bruising football areas sneaking forward getting in field goal position picked up about 3 yard the quarterback sneak exhausting the angle slightly to the,0
middle of the field to get that ball in position and now delicious field goal that will win the american league championship there on the,0
18 yard line tommy booker will attempt the field goal and i think it s pretty safe to predict about an 11 man rush by,0
houston when dawson will hole that s the ballast point dallas is calling for timeout they want to get everything set for this field goal,0
attempt that if they would make it will give them the championship and the game well while we have a moment here while in dawson,0
and his torch hank stram confer we want to remind you that im sunday january 13th many of the stars youve seen in this championship,0

overtime period dallas won the first half 17 to nothing houston won the second half 17 to nothing and ended up in a tie they,0

cbs television sports presents the national football league from cali stadium in milwaukee wisconsin it s the 20th annual midwest shrine football game featuring those,0
longtime rivals the green bay packers and the chicago bears good evening ladies and gentlemen im ray scott by my side our analyst paul chris,0
paul nice to be with you again ray always fun to start the season you know these preseason games are to always see veteran get,0
a look at the rookies we have many great rookies on each side one i can say and you know dave hampton number 25 for,0
the packers well see a lot more but keep your eye on him okay paul to complete our team of cbs broadcast reporters this evening,0
to the field now and bruce roberts well ryan late this afternoon and early this evening the rains change in the rockies coffees stadium since,0
is stopped field as fast and dried the temperature a delightful 71 degrees and there was little if any wind at all so we have,0
ideal conditions for tonight s game between the bears and we mentioned a moment ago that this is the 20th annual midwest shrine football game,0
and it is indeed more than a football game it is a true extravaganza in every sense of the word in just a moment our,0
masked fans will play our national anthem it will take a moment or two as you might expect for the field to be cleared for,0
para tori to the start of this evening s game and paul christened it will give me an opportunity to ask you about the latest,0
from the camp of the chicago bears because i do believe that some sort of a virus hit the bears right bree im sorry to,0
announce and i dont think they gave us this to announcement but another six people on their ballclub have been hit by this virus today,0
it s nothing terribly serious but enough to weaken you and they dont need any out for an alibi because that forward wall of theirs,0
has just been broken up severely between retirements people who are not in camp and so forth and so on theyve got a lot of,0
rookies in here one of the things tonight that will affect the game just a little bit the kicker in that weather report that bruce,0
roberts gave humidity 82 percent and that means a lot of perspiration and im not saying this to be as a gag im serious youll,0
see youll probably see a lot of wristbands tonight because people will be there hands would be like theyre playing and sighing so much of,0
this type of weather but it s a magnificent football night there are the friendly bears for wisconsin the bears have played two preseason games,0
lost to the washington redskins in the mire of robert kennedy stadium in washington last week defeated the miami dolphins how about the starting quarterback,0
tonight for the bears what s really going to be jack concannon coach dooley tells us and he will stay with him most of the,0
way we may see a little of douglas tonight to ray we have one oddity mr agajanian is teaching kicking for the bears there s,0
a young man named mr agajanian on the fakirs who is a rookie this year larry 63 250 pounds of defensive tackle that is ben,0
s son on the other side as far as the packers are concerned now paul you made mention of one young man dave hampton number,0
25 and although we havent had a chance to see him in person i would have to say that for a young man who has,0
played just one preseason game the word has really spread about this young man from the university of wyoming right you know when an exciting,0
runner hits the the game as gale sayers did a couple of years ago the word is around immediately and this is the type of,0
man he is they will also start rich moore from villanova we had a quick look at gale sayers and i can say this gale,0
as the packers take the field here at county stadium before yet another capacity crowd sayers was hit very hard ball on a number of,0
occasions last week against the miami dolphins and he has pronounced himself ready to go and i believe that head coach jim dooley has said,0
he will start ray there is no question in sayers mind that he is ready to go one of the there he is right there,0
number 40 one of the difficulties of the knee on the comeback not only the psychological one that youve heard about once it s physically,0
ok sometimes literally the taping gives them trouble they until they learn to tape this exactly right they dont get real great mobility out of,0
the knee and sometimes theyre taped to snug and they cant stretch out on the long run that type of a thing it takes a,0
few games until the man gets used to that knee being taped exactly the way he wants it where the trainer wants it this may,0
be one of the things with sayers the officials for tonight s game the referee is pat haggerty the umpire frank sinkovitz the head linesman,0
tom hensley the lion judge richard jorgensen the back judge gorton mccarter and the field judges tony scorer will tell you again the scene is,0
county stadium in milwaukee the occasion the 20th annual midwest shrine game the green bay packers are wearing their dark green jerseys gold football pants,0
gold helmets white numerals and the bears as the visitors are wearing their white with dark numerals i do not believe we will have the,0
usual indication as to who won the toss so we will tell you that the packers did win the toss they will be receiving at,0
the goal line through your left the bears are moving out onto the field as the packers gather around their head coach phil benson one,0
of the fine kickers in the national football league will be kicking off for the bears in the person of mack percival the packers have,0
played one preseason game and their kicker mike mercer kicked a winning field goal in the closing seconds to allow the packers to edge the,0
giants deep as percival tees up the ball number 23 is travis williams you remember him and number 25 is paul brother dave hampton the,0
young man paul kristen told you about so were about ready to go and on this very pleasant evening in milwaukee were glad youre with,0
us here on cbs and i hope i havent jinxed that young man and barely that happens when you give him a building mac first,0
of all of the bears dave hampton at the 5:00 tom greenlee a defensive back for the bears made the tackle the packers start from,0
their own 32 yard line first down 10 bart starr number 15 as the starting quarterback anderson 44 and grabowski 33 are the running backs,0
donnie anderson about four yards to the 36 the wide receivers for green bay number 86 boyd doubter to the left side on the first,0
down play number 84 carroll dale was wide to the right and the tight end is number 81 marv flemming the running backs the quarterback,0
the wide receivers the tight end are all veterans for the packers a gain of four at a second down six to the wide side,0
the left goes dale and to the right is dollar just a yard or so for kapowski veteran quarterback bart starr tampered much of last,0
season by injuries and so far in the preseason he has been physically sign and also wearing for the first time a protective device around,0
his ribs a very thin layer i dont know whether it s metal or not i think it s a type of plastic at least,0
he has a type of rib pad on tonight different than anything that s been worn before third and five from the packer 37 boyd,0
fowler is at the fair 49 here s dollar up the top of your picture he was not the primary receiver there goes anderson over,0
the middle and he circle in and pull the defender with him momentarily dollar was just going straight and turning at the last moment and,0
took the ball lead calend made the tackle first and ten packers fair 49 donny anderson about a yard after catching that pass down or,0
left the game and was replaced by bucky pope number 80 will set the packer interior lineman at center ken bowman 57 a veteran the,0
guards are highland 50 gillingham 68 and the tackles are pay 71 on the left side and haim 72 on the right side after this,0
next play will set the bear defense for you there is no score the packers are second and nine at the chicago bear 48 game,0
just underway three minutes old incomplete marv flemming the intended receiver and paul i think i spotted there s some bear linebackers blitzing yes and,0
you also saw what is known in football business by many terms one of them is a drag patter and the tight end goes down,0
under control speed the flanker goes down very rapidly the tight end turns at the last moment to the outside in the vacated area and,0
they worked it very well starr barely overthrew him the bear front for phillips 86 evie 79 home and 85 in oh bradovich 87 third,0
and nine grabowski he is close to a first down number 71 francis cave applied a crushing block on on linebacker dan fried watch the,0
timing on star he s really rushed there s a that s been practiced a lot because he keeps grabowski right in stride and that,0
little circle pattern is tough to hit on the run watch this block ahead of him now if we can get a look at it,0
there it is right there that s the block that ray scott was talking about and grabowski comes up behind joe taylor was injured on,0
the play a field goal attempt by mike mercer starr holding at the bare 46 on fourth down so the packers lead on mike mercer,0
s 46 yard field goal joe runk a firstyear player from purdue will be kicking off just over 11 minutes left to play first quarter,0
45 is gordon and body is sayers theyre inside the chicago bear 5yard line well that wasnt the run that was winkler who kicked off,0
sayers humble a defensive back leon hardin i believe recovered the fumble at any rate the packers had the ball first and ten at the,0
bare 14 yard line anderson and grabowski rather running backs behind the slide anderson to the 11 defensive back gary lyle number 44 is in,0
for the bears and will set the rest of the bear defense for you now we told you the front four of phillips eb pullman,0
and obrenovic the linebackers are buffone 55 but just in the middle 51 and fried 57 on the right with only two pops and eight,0
yards to go dont be surprised if he throws remember he s got to make it in two or else he has to take field,0
goal unless he s very close to a first down on for lebowski about the 8 yard line where he is met by number 87,0
and obradovich the deep 4 for the bears joe taylor number 20 is the right cornerback benny mccray 26 is the left cornerback d farley,0
kalam 23 and gary lyle 44 now in stars position what do you do 5 yards to go he must have great faith in his,0
running game as you saw there do you run twice and try to get to the 5 or do you throw once and if it,0
fails go for the field goal hey catch on 3rd and 5 anderson it appears that star wanted to get the ball into good position,0
for a kick around the 5 yard line it did look like a position play he s right almost in the middle of field and,0
so mike mercer the packer field goal kicker comes in he would have had another choice it assuming he is going to kick on this,0
play but had they been closer say down to one yard or half a yard he probably would have gone for the first down down,0
here instead of taking the field oh but he has almost two and a half yards to go mercer kicked five field goals in the,0
winning effort against the giants made six to nothing oh paul a bit of trickery by the packers in that last kickoff it wasnt runk,0
who kicked off at the man alongside of him winkler yes because the to bear deep receivers are standing together and theyve isolated everyone on,0
one side of the field by kicking on the side on the hash mark there as you see comparatively short gordon has it at the,0
15 he is tackled by dave hampton and the bears have it at the fair 17 yard line we remind you this telecast is presented,0
by authority of the national football league it is intended for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or other use of this telecast,0
without the express written consent of the national football league is prohibited mike mercer who is two for two in field goals tonight and seven,0
already in the first two game concannon at quarterback the handoff is to ronny bull number 29 ray let s explain that kickoff a little,0
more thoroughly we didnt have enough time there sayers and gordon the deep receivers stand together they dont like to spread so that the kicking,0
team doesnt know who is going to get the ball but when the kicking team the packers moved over to the right hash mark that,0
moved both receivers over to the bears left head all right leaving the wide open section of the field which they kicked you on that,0
opening kick sayers number 40 lined up behind the quarterback concannon on second down eight sayers watch number 66 put the stop on him here,0
meets him at the line of scrimmage right there and takes him down there was a gain of about two and a half yards and,0
for the bears who trail six nothing here midway in the first quarter it s third and five from their 22 sayers to the 29,0
yard it will be fourth bound three just in case anybody didnt recognize number 66 ray that s the venerable ray nitschke who is playing,0
just as well as the first year he came in the league the punter for the bears is in bobby joe green number 88 the,0
clock shows a bit over six minutes left to play in the first quarter the packers lead panthulu 25 and at the bottom of the,0
screen travis williams 23 inside the factor 30 to receive an expected punt from the bears bobby green that s ronny bull blocking in front,0
of the cutter bearcats hampton at the packer 40 and for the packers number 15 well be the quarterback number 33 grabowski number 44 anderson,0
will be the running backs dale $84 86 will be the two wide receivers as we look at the green bay packer bench 6nothing green,0
bay five and a half minutes remaining first quarter to the right side comes dale the receiver carol dale was ruled to have been out,0
of bounds defending was lyle 44 and mcrae 26 if there are any changes for the bears evy 79 phillips 86 holmen 85 or bradovich,0
87 there in the front floor ii found 10 green bay from the packer $40 left dale right grabowski theyre 45 yardline and you you,0
know what that play is that s the old old draw it s a simulated pass it looks like stars going back to throw watch,0
him see the handoff there he goes picking up a blocker right here on the first man and if you can get fire that first,0
pile up you got a little room to maneuver here goes go bow ski it s a first down for the packers at the bear,0
44 the big block was by donnie anderson anderson a gain of about eight yards before mccray and lyle made the tackle take a look,0
at it now watch the guard pull ahead there s a good block right there they trapped the outside man there are took him to,0
the outside anderson spinning picking up some yardage on his own after he leaves his blockers second down a little more than two yards to,0
go for a first down six nothing the packers lead four minutes left to play first quarter grabowski and there s nothing there third down,0
and two donnie anderson and again there is no pain no gain and it s fourth down and the mike mercer it appears is going,0
to try yet another field goal i dont think you can credit any slicked field of that slip there this field is in excellent shape,0
they had a slight drizzle in the afternoon but it never did four down and the field is in good shape now the bears are,0
dropping back leak allen one of their defensive backs star in holding position around the bear 43 yard line mercer has already kicked one of,0
46 and then a shortly it is wide to the left and on the touchback the bears take over again the bear running backs our,0
bull 29 sayers 40 wide to the right gordon 45 and copeland 36 concannon a quarterback from the bear 20 shares for three years there,0
he is met by nicky the tight end for the bears is austin denny 80 for the bear interior lineman jackson 65 a tackle free,0
walls 60 left guard file at center 52 deal at right guard 72 and rufus maze number 71 at right tackle for the bears second,0
down seven ronny bowl into the heart of the packer defensive line met first by linebacker deroy cathy number 60 number 38 coming off the,0
bench for the bears right now is a wide receiver ray ogden he s going into the tight end right now in replace of denny,0
on third down three for the bears in the bare 27 a little over a minute left to play first quarter the factors 86 nothing,0
sayers it appears that sayers is just shy of a first down he had to reach the 30 mitch key number 66 eightyseven willie david,0
theyre shy of a first down by a yard it is fourth and one green is in the punch to hampton 25 and williams that,0
s travis williams 23 now there is another williams with the packers perry williams a firstyear back from purdue wow travis williams at the 16,0
for the 27yard rudy wittenberg met him there it s fine coverage by the bears ray because he out kicked his tacklers and when that,0
happened that s the time when the man gets a chance to receive the ball get a little running room that s where trouble develops,0
if they covered the kick very well just a couple of seconds left to play in the first quarter we may not get off the,0
play we will not there s the gun that s the end in the first quarter with the score the green bay packers six the,0
chicago bears nothing the packers have several changes the running backs are now travis williams 23 and mersin 30 and at a guard bill luke,0
number 32 has replaced bob highland bart starr is still at quarterback travis williams and a loss of two dick edie mainly responsible for stopping,0
that play number 79 i said luke 32 bill duke is 62 loss of two second down 12 the packers in the packer 25 the,0
bears still have the same front for phillips evie holman obrenovic to the right fowler to the left dale on second down 12 intended for,0
chuck mercy oh brad a bitch wasnt flying great pressure on heart star and that s what cars i told you that to keep a,0
runner to keep a receiver in perfect stride on that little circle pattern that the full background or the back that stays in is awfully,0
hard to do frequently youll see him have to turn around and in that time even if he catches the ball he loses his momentum,0
and that rushed by obradovich cause that throw to be a little off target it s third and 12 or green bay from the packers,0
25 made the tackle with help from li callen number 23 on mar fleming the packard tight end and it s a first down for,0
green bay at the green bay 41 mersin for a quick coupler there was a gain of three in a second down seven green bay,0
from the packer 44 travis williams one yard where he met willie holman third down six a quick observation i would have to say that,0
their front seven working just about as well as they did at the end of the year last year if theyre very grudgingly team on,0
defense they give that yardage up in a tough way star sends dale to the right and dollar to the left mersin shoulder what star,0
look downfield man downfield his cover turns and throws to the safety valve man now here is a blocker he doesnt even need to block,0
they evade right there youll see mr butkus after a twist here by the runner is parsley tackle watch 51 come out of nowhere from,0
the left of your screen right here and it s good night irene forth and for a short punt it s down at the barre,0
29 yard line ken vineyard a firstyear picker from texas tech was doing the hunting that time and there s a penalty flag up field,0
at the packer 35 yard line a personal foul roughing the kicker against the bears first down green at the bear 38 yard line particularly,0
tough break with bears because that was the first time they would have been off of their own 20 so by now as concannon has,0
not thrown yet but he s been the shadow his own goalpost each time that he goes in there he s only been in series,0
to the right is dale into the leftist dowler merci for the 35 86 there is phillips 79 evy 51 dick butkus 57 is the,0
new member of that front 7 paul kristen was talking about dan fried replaced jim pernell who was traded mersin left the game limping travis,0
williams looking for a receiver deal the new man in the backfield who came in when racine was injured is the other williams of the,0
packers so we have travis williams 23 and perry williams 31 a firstyear back from purdue in the game now for green bay you know,0
in the last series travis williams ran that same play which is obviously a option passive run for the halfback at back option they call,0
it and at that time he gave a little ground and i wondered if he was dropping back to to throw on the previous down,0
this time he did it third down seven ten and a half minutes left to play first half six nothing green bay star loses about,0
four ëtil bradovich wraps him up around the 40 and in comes the kicking you know and that means mike mercer he has been successful,0
on two or three this evening he has one to his credit of 46 yards it would appear this will be from about 47 or,0
48 li calendars back inside the 10 for the bears will watch from behind the goalposts at the 47 of the bears star is holding,0
well it may be a little bit trite to say it paul but certainly the foots been in football here tonight as far as the,0
factors are concerned he s kicking this thing like it s going out of style he had plenty of room to spare on that one,0
from 47 the packers have sports 31 points now in two games and he score at all but six now that s winkler kicking off,0
this is gordon running for it at the six out for round the 30 and written down by leon harden is dick gordon and jackson,0
cannon the chicago bears quarterback will put the ball in play from the bear 30 and cannon out on the 30 now with a little,0
room to operate a little elbow you might see the ball in the air a bit the packer front for aldrich 82 rich moore 70,0
jordan 74 davis 87 gordon to the left copeland to the left concannon looking for sayers taffy was in pursuit it s incomplete the chicago,0
bear interior lineman 71 there is rufus mays the big and highly regarded firstyear player from ohio state and offensive right tackle to deal 72,0
at right guard pile 50th center free walled 60 at the inner guard and jackson 65 at the other tackle was second and 10 the,0
bears from the bear 30 jordan you might have a first down wall is right on the 40yard line all right this is going watch,0
this stop head bang puts his foot down there s the ball in there right on time and that s the kind of a pass,0
believe it or not just a little bit more time to maneuver when a fast man like gordon cannot maneuver even to tacklers at times,0
and you and your five yard pass goes for 50 yards jeter made the tackle the bears have their initial first down of the game,0
incomplete gordon intended receiver natalie was the cornerback number 26 defendant and to complete the packer defense the deep men are doug hart 43 and,0
willie wood 24 and im sure you notice a similarity garden on the left a five yard stop pass you made it first down garden,0
on the right the same thing on this side theyre testing both carnufex see how tightly they are playing a flanking and are back concannon,0
has completed one of three it is second and ten for the bears from their 40 stairs the 43yard line he met willy would and,0
then mickey ray there s another thing to know about the fiveyard stop pass as far as the passer is concerned if he is unsure,0
with rookie blockers in here whether theyll be able to handle the veteran defensive line of the packers or any other team that short pass,0
requires an almost no protection it s gotten off very quickly so he doesnt need great blocking in this way he can get an idea,0
while he s throwing whether he does have good blocking or not it s a third and seven play coming up concannon doug hart almost,0
intercepted in front of austin denny the intended receiver and it is fourth and seven that was a screen pass and the screen man was,0
covered he had no place to unload the ball but there was really no danger when he saw the situation developing it looked like a,0
near interception but he threw that thing down all the way it would have been almost impossible in herself why is we done this for,0
is nine nothing the packers are leading eight minutes left to play first tab and green is in to punt for the bears same two,0
deep men for green bay travis williams 23 dave hampton 25 oh he hung this went up in the air bearcats whoop he punched it,0
or not there s a french back travis williams very nearly and if he had touched that thing in a row in the endzone the,0
bears got it that s a free ball would have been six points with the score the packers nine and the bears nothing a number,0
of changes for the factors a new quarterback don horn number 13 wide receivers 85 phyllis 41 fred and berg running back by the two,0
williams travis williams no game take a look at butkus number 51 right here middle linebacker watch him play the play soon as he sees,0
the hand up moved to the whole area is in the hole helping on the tech he had to come in high because he had,0
a tackler under there was no gain at his second and 10 breton bird 41 left side 85 s phyllis right side about three yards,0
for travis williams net by phillips 86 seven minutes left in the first half the factors are leading by three mike mercer field goals one,0
of forty seven one of 46 yards and another from in close just in case anybody in chicago doesnt remember mr horn number 13 him,0
off the bench last year and gave him all the trouble in that final game as he came out of the services you did before,0
it s third and side penalty flags all over the place or a nail back inside the 20 yard line by dick evey this penalty,0
i was positive is gonna be on the packer isnt ray i should have explained we could have almost expected that when particularly at this,0
time of the year when you change quarterbacks you get a new rhythm in your call and very often you see an offsides or alignment,0
backing up a little early on the play starting a little early and that s what she saw there the bears stopped him and of,0
course beats used the penalty it was a loss anyway in the punt is vineyard sayers has been joined by lyle this time deep men,0
for the bears bearcats by stairs ronni full number 29 and gale sayers number 40 will be the chicago running backs concannon will be the,0
quarterback again number 11 copeland 36 gordon 45 theyll be the wide receivers the tight end is denny 84 the clock shows 610 left the,0
play in the first half as the bears come up to the line of scrimmage first and 10 at the bare 36 yard line this,0
is sayers the packers had robinson the left linebacker blitzing and there is a gain on the play of about eight yards i think just,0
that little maneuver after sarah s caught the ball indicates it should to you that he still has that great mobility i believe the only,0
question is gonna be now is if sayers pops open for a long in whether he can stretch out like he used to so very,0
rapidly well we may see that before the evening is over several changes for green bay rouser 45 at the one corner flanagan 55 is,0
a linebacker in the middle second of the two stairs met by robinson and flannigan gain of one itll be third and one ogden number,0
38 rae ogden is in now a tight end in place of denny for the bears third down about two yards to go for a,0
first down gordon to the left ogden to the left penalty flags are down ronny bull was trying to run wide the official attendance tonight,0
"47,000 14 the penalty against the package it gives the bears of first down at the chicago 49 yard line illegal procedure is defended third",0
quarter score philadelphia eagles 14 miami dolphins 3 brian piccolo one of the bears who has been hit by the against the flu bug paul,0
yes he was the original case that they had on the ballclub it was hit the hardest he s in there now brian piccolo replacing,0
sayers almost intercepted by flanagan it was intended for piccolo this is brian piccolo number 41 watch him there s a little circle pattern right,0
here and youll see it s almost intercepted at the last moment right there a drop fortunately for the bears a changed offensively for the,0
packers vander see number 83 at defensive right end for the bears second down ten from there 49 four and a half minutes left to,0
play first half the packers lead 9 nothing concannon a screen to piccolo and dave robinson has him after a gain of the yard brian,0
piccolo last year after sears got hurt he had a he had a very fine year i think the whole ballclub ray decided they just,0
didnt have the big breakaway man anymore and they had to go and that all of the running backs picked up it seemed like bobbili,0
number 46 in has a wide receiver for the bears on the left side along with gordon on third and nine denny the intended receiver,0
chafee and robinson were pressuring them it is fourth and nine breen in the punt the last time he punted we did one of about,0
58 yards fair catch travis williams bears have it the bears have it around the packer 25 yards watch him go through a sea of,0
white jerseys here make a dive for the ball look like he had it gets it in his arms no just out on his fingertips,0
and drops it went through his hands and it s recovered by the bears tim and casey one of the bear linebackers and dan fried,0
were there and one of the two of them came up with the ball see if concannon runs or tries to hit quickly here let,0
s find that first ten bears at the packer 25 ronny bull he ran into flanagan 55 and cathy 60 and rich moore 73 minutes,0
to play in the first half its second and eight for the bears the packer 23 jackson cannon has quarterback the bears all of the,0
first and he sends lee and gordon to the left his tight end is on the right side danny brian piccolo inside the 20yard line,0
will be third down and about for now copeland replaces lead number 36 copeland for the bears and probably a play coming in he has,0
two choices here they run for a position and hope to pick up the first down or i throw and try to pick up the,0
first down this is easier the quickest way to get to five yards of course because it s a pretty long way to run and,0
then take the field goal if he doesnt do jack concannon has huddle at the sidelines with jim dooley and members of jim duties coaching,0
staff and for the bears it s third and fourth factor 19 two minutes left to play first half nine nothing green bay practically no,0
gain nailed ronnie bull at the line of scrimmage so now mac first of all the chicago bear place kicker comes in on fourth down,0
and four concannon is in holding position at the 26 yard line green bay mack percival puts the bears on the board it s now,0
nine to three in the favor of the packers 26yard field goal for mack percival would blossom to blossom last year into one of the,0
outstanding kickers in professional football first of all kicks travis williams out across the 22 about the packer 24 yard line with just over a,0
minute remaining in the first half you know the oldest saw in football is make a mistake in professional footballer to cost you couple of,0
pints weve seen two fumbles tonight immediately followed by a two field goals by the opponent ill pass it worse brendan berg is wide to,0
the left 41 horne 13 is the packer quarterback this is phyllis out at the 36 yard line but a fear the packers are going,0
into their twominute drill there will be no huddle here benny mccrae made the tackle that time the bears of course taking their time getting,0
back across the line of scrimmage clock is running now were ready to go first and ten but just broke that down intended for dollars,0
one two three four five six seven eight of the bears had dropped off the line that time in defending against the obvious path that,0
s a prevent prevent for its second and 10 for the fakirs the clock shows 35 seconds left to play in the first half number,0
31 is perry williams he picked up about five yards to the packer 41 the packers immediately called timeout a new center down where the,0
packers under 58 francis winkler is it centered pray one of the things i noticed ive often wondered about is non horn goes over to,0
the sidelines to confer with his coaching staff the national football league changed the rule a number of years are going rightfully so because when,0
youre doing this hurry up thing and you said no huddle they will continue to go without a huddle you saw some of the bears,0
after a completed pass against the bears walking back down the field and walking right through the huddle or right through the huddle area of,0
the packers in other words they couldnt start to play until the bears had got on the other side of the line of scrimmage some,0
years ago that used to delay you you couldnt go fast because you were waiting for the defense to get back unless you wanted to,0
call it play and catch them offsides and that often worked against you as well as them broke your timing now the time doesnt start,0
so everybody gets back across the line of scrimmage third and five it s ruled a fumble that was not ruled an attempted pass that,0
ball was loose holmen jarred the ball loose from horn take another look at it now this is a this is a threeman rush and,0
you see the way they worked a stunt on that thing and he got to him there and now he raised his arm but he,0
was not bringing him forward to throw he was pulling his arm back down and as he brought his arm back down to touch the,0
ball to his side it went out of his hand that was a real good rush for three minutes travis william has recovered the ball,0
for the packers then youre just hunting they all out rushed was long and somebody partially blocked it i do believe it is down at,0
the packer 45 yard line by terry frettin burt and the bears now have asked for a timeout clock shows seven seconds there you can,0
see it seven seconds left to play in the first half well brakes have got a lot to do with our 9 to 3 score,0
as paul crispin pointed out several homes to go bears guilty of a fumble immediately turned into a threepointed by the fakirs and travis williams,0
tumble of a punt turned into a field goal by percival who right now has come onto the field back percival with concannon in holding,0
position alice watch closely from 52 yards percival will apparently try a few willie would and there is the god in the first half with,0
the store chicago bears 300 no im a 34c of them and im considered rather regal and just as hard to find as a longlegged,0
beagle who are you im a im a national highway side here in germany and international highway side kirk i come in different shapes well,0
what does that sign mean oh right there all right side says do not enter as you can see ill tell you a story if,0
you listen to me halloween in germany a soldier named maher saw a circle around a big white bar it stood like a sentry proclaiming,0
no entry and it meant both mars and his car oh drew so now you know until mister side and the way here we go,0
play the wise man not the fool when you drive a car man drive cool back to football and halftime here at milwaukee county stadium,0
it s the packers 9 and the bears 3 let s take a look at some of the highlights and we see that winkler kicks,0
off and the surprise maneuver and it caught everybody surprise watch gale sayers he goes up high for the ball and he fumbles it with,0
a green bay republic mike mercer kicks three field goals now let s take a look at the the second star holding it s up,0
and it s good made of six nothing want to say olx get a draw play what s this one is trabocchi on the draw,0
close for about 30 yards there is those 33 let s take a look at that one again in slow motion and you see how,0
it dropped by should be run a handoff the offensive lineman committed themselves great block and grabovski continues on going for 30 yards as mike,0
mercer s third field goal is pasted in a row now for one of the few bear highlights at the first half what s travis,0
will you call for a fair catch and he just seems to lose the ball got it then he has it and the bear is,0
recovered let s take a look at that one again in slow motion it seems that he might have taken his eye off the ball,0
at the very last moment can we see bobby joel green of the bears back to five and there you see williams looking looking looking,0
and otto reaches falls to his right and in fact and the bears recover in later score the field goal we have statistics of the,0
first half green bay five first downs the chicago bears could only manage to in total offensive yards the packers 84 the bears 44 and,0
that yards rushing 46 to 25 and in passing 38 to 19 so the statistics fairly well reflect the score of 9 to 3 at,0
halftime with the green bay packers ahead now let s return to the bull and ray scott thank you bruce roberts well were almost ready,0
to begin the second half with green bay kicking to chicago so the score as were just about ready to start the second half the,0
green bay packers 9 the chicago bears 3 as mike mercer has kicked 3 field goals and mac first of all the one for the,0
bears i im gonna im gonna do a firsttier paul i ordinarily would do this but i know that our director would would dearly love,0
to know what is up on the scoreboard here in the way of a message under phantogram im gonna die they took it down i,0
tell you what it said folks it said cbs tv we love you for your great job and i thought it was good to pass,0
up and wouldnt you know what they took it that pretty good rock you pulled up work there s an instant replay of what you,0
didnt see so the packers are getting ready to kick off deep for the bears packer fans are showing how they feel about the upcoming,0
season sayers and gordon back and it appears that your runk will kick but remember now number 58 to his right actually kicked in the,0
first half in the same situation gordon chasing it he will not run out and so the bears down nine to three well start first,0
down ten from the chicago bear 20yard line coach tim duty of the bears indicated that he would go with jack kincannon most of the,0
game at quarterback and concannon is in there now his running backs are stairs 40 and full 29 wide receivers gordon 45 copeland 36 to,0
the left side sayers about five yards for gale sayers sayers up until tonight had carried the ball 15 times for 69 yards and all,0
of that came last week against the miami dolphins because in the rain and mud of the game against the redskins he did not carry,0
the ball from scrimmage 2nd down 5 and 1/2 ronny bull close to a first down to 29 there he s met by number 74,0
of the packers henry jordan i dont know what coach dooley said at the half to the bears but the last two plays they have,0
moved although they werent long gains they have moved that packer defensive line out of there better in two plays and they have the entire,0
first half in other words they have a much better charge the second they have up to here third and a half yard to go,0
for a first down sayers i think youll say guard doug free walled at the bottom there for the bears aldrich of the pack is,0
82 there s pre wall number 60 89 robinson it is fourth down and short of a first down by about a foot or so,0
and bobby joe green is into five packers had nine men up at the front that time and wisely saw the gamble theyd be no,0
throw and theyve stopped that first down attempt 23 is travis williams bottom of the screen 25 dave hampton the bears down it at the,0
factor 27 yard line as williams and hampton elected not to handle the run ralph kurek found it at that point here s a second,0
quarter score new orleans 16 denver nothing right here the score is 9 to 3 in favor of the packers 13 minutes left to play,0
third quarter at quarterback star running backs anderson 44 hrabowski 33 grabowski out of bounds around the 30 yard line gain a little better than,0
three yards second down six 44 is donnie anderson 86 there s veteran wide receiver boyd out to the left tail to the right doubter,0
on second down seven hrabowski to the 33 final score the philadelphia eagles 14 miami dont we can frank cornish is in the front line,0
now number 73 for the bears joining evy 79 phillips 86 and holmen 85 as obrenovic is getting a rest for the packers third down,0
and four yards away from a first down intended wardell linebacker doug buffone covered that receiver whether the intended receiver was donnie anderson not carol,0
d and the phone did a good job because it was partially bad and almost caught and batted again the forn stayed with him until,0
he finally had to drop the ball fourth down then dirt into punt deep sears around the bear twenty ten yards in front of him,0
while while at the 25 a determined run back by lyle to around the bear 31 where the unhardened made the tax three and a,0
half minutes have gone by in the second half the bears are first and ten at their 31 and kenan intended for ronnie bull with,0
doug hart coming up to cover okay paul ii intend the bears from their 31 tightend austin denny s for about an eightyard gain only,0
this speaking of sending in questions speaking for all of the analysts in the league both leagues about in fact im sure i am when,0
i say that many times we receive questions from fans in the mail that require five and six pages to answer it to give a,0
real good answer and ill be delighted to discuss these things rather than try to write them to all the people when the bears third,0
down and 2 to the right gordon everybody else studying tight for the bear gordon has a first down at the 43 he is hit,0
very hard by curve a dirty number 26 that incidentally was an excellent call and very well done by concannon because the last time he,0
hit a couple of yards to go green they pulled at nine man line on ik couldnt make it he made the quick throw here,0
which is rather safe it must be time very rapidly because they play the receiver close knowing that that nine man line will be barreling,0
in there and he has the passer has released quickly five of eleven completions for concannon out of bounds gordon breaking downfield robinson dropped off,0
and there was a mixup on that play watch concannon there number 11 coming over to talk to his man gordon ran a stop and,0
go concannon threw a stop this is very dangerous because there s no receiver there when the ball comes down and there might be an,0
enemy and that s almost what happened and what probably happened was he said were gonna throw a stop but if youre closely covered run,0
a stop and go pattern he thought he was open on the stop but the receiver didnt and he kept going second and ten affair,0
43 sayers got away from and i think sara s recovered yes at the packer 13 take a look at stairs top of your screen,0
little swing better no watch here s what we were wondering watch him stretch out right here this is what we were wondering whether he,0
could do it or not see those legs stretch out it doesnt appear anything to be anything wrong with that here s a little maneuver,0
right here he cuts on the bad knee bad leg i should say there s no apparent trouble looks like mr sayers is headed for,0
a pretty good here and he recovers his own fumble there first down the bears at the packer 39 he s throwing for gordon that,0
was a fly pattern our boat pattern you just get into the starting blocks and set sail theyve been doing all that foolishness on the,0
sidelines i mean the quick stops and you turn outs and so forth he did a little jog step and just kept right on going,0
so we have a tie game and mac percival is in to try and put the bears ahead by a point 39 yards concannon to,0
gorton when i say all the forces i mean he was trying to set up a couple of defensive backs is what he was doing,0
concannon holding for percival the bears lead by 10 denying these same two longtime rivals you know meet the opening day of the nfl season,0
in green bay on september 21 mac first of all it prepares to kickoff dave hampton he s upset by linebacker tim casey at about,0
the 18 yard line of the packers the running backs for green bay will be 33 grabowski 44 anderson quarterback this farm wide right dale,0
wide left carol dale watch him cross to his left this is a long crossover pattern watch tim c star throw between the defenders oh,0
theyre dropping straight back in a line pretty straight back and he waits for the receiver to go between them 25 yard game first down,0
at the packer 43 hrabowski out of bounds at the bear 43 yard line how they hooked the bear defensive end hope keep him in,0
there here comes fro bough ski around the end eventual tackler who didnt tackle and knock him out of bounds just gave him a rolling,0
block here fell down got up in time to just shove him out of bounds there over the side it s a first down for,0
the factory but theyre 43 yard holman hot star from behind for a loss of about 10 for the bears now in addition to holden,0
number 85 cornish 73 evy 79 and amsler 81 make up the front floor a loss of 10 yards a second down 20 the first,0
time a real good rush has been put on star and of course this give a lot of momentum to that bear defensive line the,0
bears are leading by a score of 10 to 9 after trailing by 9 nothing dowler to the wide side of the field the right,0
frances pay made the tackle on hazleton and the bears have the ball at the packard 15yard line what s taro dale slip past the,0
painter hazleton here derek see dale right down here and there hazen takes the ball it was thrown to the short man he stepped inside,0
of him picked it off so here are the bears first and ten at the factor 15 7:45 left to play third quarter running backs,0
now our montgomery 22 and hull 33 montgomery about two yards rock montgomery number 22 is a firstyear back from texas christian 63 220 we,0
have not seen it this year we saw it a lot last year concannon is a good runner and in this situation oftentimes came up,0
with the rollout play as i say i havent seen a music much r at all this year certainly not in this ball game but,0
this is the type of situations concannon used to like to run the roll out option pass our run second down incomplete at the goal,0
line intended for gordon bobby lee is in now as one of the wide receivers for the bears number 46 well the bears now it,0
is third and nine at the packer 14 and canons little mad at himself there he actually heard himself he had enough time but this,0
happens two passes after theyve been rushed enough time and they do get enough time they they just automatically hurry a little bit he threw,0
a little sooner than he wanted to didnt get himself set and didnt get the ball on target he s mad at himself 7 of,0
15 passes completed by concannon one touchdown mike hall no gain position play hell go lionel aldridge met hall at the line of scrimmage and,0
mac percival comes in with the other members of the chicago bear kicking unit what we say position play that doesnt mean necessarily he s,0
just running to a spot and dropping dead it means he s going to a particular hole in trying to blast through for a first,0
time but if he doesnt he ends up in good position for a field goal attempt concannon holding at the packer 22 perceval hips yet,0
another way the bears need 39 mac percival tees it up dave hampton number 525 one of the two deep then for the factors the,0
other is 23 travis williams travis williams at the to the 23 yard line emilio baez made the tackle this is the 50th year of,0
national football league activity so of course attention will center on the pro football hall of fame this year in canton ohio the greatest stars,0
of the game are enshrined their historical highlights of 75 years of pro football activity are shown to the public there donny anderson maybe a,0
yard game doug buffone led the defense of charge number 55 for the bears another note on the hall of fame in canton ohio here,0
are the hours daily 9:00 in the morning till 8:00 in the evening through august and that closes a five oclock each day starting in,0
september gray when you consider how difficult it is even to make a profession team and then you think of those people who were selected,0
to be above and beyond their contemporaries what great players they must have been there was no gain at a second and ten dowler he,0
s at the 38yard line and a packer first at and fried made the factory star has had pretty good success everywhere tonight im sure,0
if the sentence is very high but he is having great success over the middle against the bed typically on the crossover stuff you saw,0
one carol dale a little while ago you saw that one $2 coming back the other direction john johnson 76 and 4073 are the bear,0
tackles right now dowler 44 yard line major hazleton made the tackle gain on the play of about five six yards star is going to,0
hear now 11 times he has completed six he has had one interception in his second and four for the packers at the packer 44,0
four minutes left to play third quarter 13 denying as the score and the bears are leading to the right side goes day over dollar,0
to the left hrabowski marty ansley led the defense of charge and grabowski got only about a yard third down 3 at the packer 45,0
hazleton runs over toward the bear bench and he s coming out rosie taylor replaces it number 24 donnie anderson what a great play i,0
hope number 85 85 willie holman watch this see him come under his walker there was a blocker on him great tackle got that shoulder,0
up just in time to trip anderson there it s willie holman defensive tackle giving a few statistics 6 for 250 south carolina state sayers,0
deep wild in front of him and donnie anderson is in to punt penalty marker is down lyle fair catch the bears 16 where the,0
penalty marker is at the 45 yard line of green bay so well watch referee pat haggerty dick butkus who captains the bear defensive unit,0
indicates he wants the ball to come back it s a 5yard penalty against the packers the percentages with butkus on that choice because with,0
any kind of a break at all hell get any run back obviously it s better than a fair catch and he s hoping to,0
get a little time to get one of his run back man started here are blocker kick or have a bad kick any number of,0
things just over two minutes left to play in the third period the packers have donnie anderson back at the 20 sayers fair cats 23,0
yard line they picked up seven yards about six or seven yards by virtue of accepting the pedal it s better than a sharp stick,0
in the end the chicago bear running backs are montgomery 22 and howe 33 montgomery willie davis made the tackle but the bears picked up,0
five yards on that running play there s bloody davis 87 74 henry jordan jim flanagan is in at middle linebacker for the packers number,0
55 fred car number 53 is at the right line backing spot there was a gain of four at a second down six very short,0
yardage time for mike paul dave robinson was the first to make contact for the bears third down for and you know you mentioned the,0
name theyre probably the most underrated and under publicize linebacker in my opinion in the national football league dave roberts i just happened to watch,0
him that time they have all the great line backing at green bay but you hear his name least he just calmly took an end,0
position there he is right there gathered up an arm load of blockers and made the tackle at the same time he just plays a,0
quiet great game intended for hall and itll be fourth down on that incomplete pass seconds only remaining in the third period as jack concannon,0
who has thrown for the only touchdown scored in this game 39 yards to dick gordon and that same mr robinson in that very play,0
gave hall a push broke his pattern which was perfectly legal before the ball was thrown and by the time they threw the ball over,0
robinson it was too late 25 is hampton who is right as williams 23 that s travis williams and green is punting from around the,0
bear 15 fair catch williams at the factor 30 let s see weve seen only bart starr as a quarterback in the second half we,0
"saw darn horn for a while first half terry williams 31 is one of the running backs we have a capacity crowd here over 47,000",0
the clock shows only about 20 seconds left to play in a third quarter and dave hampton number 25 is in at a running back,0
spot this is hampton as his first round take a look at mr hampton here watch him cut he sets up the block now the,0
cutback here he comes see him break tackles right on through there this he doesnt look too big out there but he s over 200,0
pounds has tremendous legs and great power that s kind of shaking him off right there and that s the end of the third quarter,0
with the score the bears 13th and the packers 9 with paul crispin and bruce roberts race got at county stadium milwaukee 4th quarter is,0
about to begin the packers have a first down at their 43 to the 47 yard line goes terry williams number 31 mike hampton williams,0
is a first year back williams played at purdue hampton at wyoming the chicago bear defensive unit 55 is buffone 51 is butkus 57 is,0
pride theyre the three linebackers second down six for green bay from the packer 47 carol dale was the intended receiver lee kalin was the,0
defending back and for green bay it is third down six there s callen number 23 44 is gary lyle 24 rosie taylor three of,0
the four members of the chicago bear secondary the fourth being 26 benny mccrae the packers on the ground 79 yards in the air 102,0
this is williams a penalty flag is down two flags are down but this a punishing tackle on harry williams that was waves and that,0
was butkus he met him at the past two penalty flags were dropped watch him now were gonna show you this again just for the,0
tech here s a fine trow by star on that little swing pattern watch now 51 coming out of nowhere and theyll meet at the,0
pass right here at is the shoulder right there and backwards the runner goes no every time you look at a ballgame in this league,0
ray you see another better linebacker theyre great one of the bears we have not been able to identify him for certain was injured on,0
the play the packers are huddling way back at their 25 so it appears the penalty is against the packers and hagrid he measures it,0
off the ball goes back to the 36 yard line personal foul flipping so now it is third and 15 perhaps 16 at the packer,0
36 there s rosie taylor he was shaken up on the last play but obviously is alright additional defense of facts are in for the,0
bears and what they believe to be a passing situation third and 16 mar fleming the intended receiver incomplete fourth down and the bears continue,0
to put pressure on with a 3 in front wall this is great rushing so the bears are leading 13 to 9 14 minutes left,0
to play in the game there is sayers inside the bear 20yard line donny andersen to punt 44 is lyle fair catch lyle and the,0
bears have the ball at their 33 packers led three nothing 6nothing nine nothing nine three at halftime the bears went ahead on a touchdown,0
pass concannon to gordon added to their lead on a first ball field goal the chicago bear running backs are montgomery 22 and hull 33,0
montgomery up around the 38 yard line jim weatherwax number 73 is in defensively now for green bay 53 is car 45 rouser bob jones,0
is in la for the bears as a wide receiver he wears number 43 gordon right side jones left side on second down 5 the,0
bears ho spun around at the 40 jim flanagan the first immediate third down and three yards to go for a first down time left,0
to play 12:45 there is number 22 from texas christian ross montgomery 63 to 20 he s a firstyear back youll get a night in,0
now excuse me whether concannon is playing us a little posey which is somewhat early to be doing if he runs or whether he puts,0
the ball in the air he s got a long way around run montgomery 43yard line take another look at this now he tries to,0
loop the ball over a defender which means it s thrown soft alright yeah we got a sink we trying to loop it over the,0
inside defender it and he had to throw it softly but he with the man tipped the ball and in tipping it tipped it over,0
his own teammate into the hands of the receiver who took it on the sideline and they are like four inches short of a first,0
down and theyre going for the first time fourth and inches watch that nine man front wall unless i miss my gut concannon has the,0
first down around the 45 penalty marker is down at the line of scrimmage against the packers fiveyard they were outside that you rarely see,0
in that situation i fully expected the bears to be in motion because concannon called it on a quick count and very often a quarterback,0
will have the ball snapped on a call before his seven men are down in a threepoint position and you get called for illegal procedure,0
first and ten the bears at the bear 48 there s a penalty marker and my call gets about two yards weatherwise it looks like,0
pat haggerty is headed the other way this time referee building a procedure against the bears final score the st louis cardinals 27 pittsburgh steeler,0
is 13 ron bull now number 29 has replaced hull in the bareback field and its 1st and 15 for chicago 12 minutes left to,0
play the bears lead 13 to 9 ronny bull hit hard by rouser around the 48:53 is fred car who was in at the right,0
linebacking spot for green bay right now you know we mentioned that when sayers was hurt last year the bear running backs just simply picked,0
up they decided they had to obviously but i think the man who had his best year was ronnie bullish he had probably the finest,0
year of his four or five year career he leaves the game and is replaced by a halt as its second and 10 the bears,0
theyre up there 49 gordon yeah first the factor 39 ad or he made the factory now his look he s out here with single,0
cover he s a quick slant in y was thrown little low he went down with it though rather than trying to stoop for you,0
generally drop it if you try to feel it like a baseball he went down to get his chest in front of that ball and,0
it came in and he caught it he kept it off the ground other bears are able to maintain ball control first and ten at,0
the packer 39 ross montgomery he s at the 32 yard line will he would made the tackle second down and three for the bear,0
montgomery close to a first down rich more number 70 jim weatherwax 73 teamed up to make that stop and for the bears third and,0
about a yard did you see concannon turn around and tell hull to move over the fullback spot instead of the halfback spot for mike,0
i sympathize with him he s new at a fullback spot this year and you know in the excitement of a game like this people,0
are throwing signals that you in there everybody s moving on somebody s supposed to tell you but in the excitement somebody fails to tell,0
you where to set up and that s what canon was doing it s third and one concannon he would need it perhaps less than,0
a yard and he got it first down the 20th annual midwest shrine football game revival of the series between the bears and the packers,0
and they will beat september 21 opening day of the national football league s regular season in green bay to the right gordon to the,0
left jones first and ten at the packer 28th rouser thought he had an interception he cut in front of jones but he couldnt hold,0
the ball and for the bears at his second and 10 willie davis now comes in for the packers replacing bill vander see at defensive,0
end chicago bear huddled running backs 33 mike oh 22 ross montgomery 2nd down 10 time left to play in the game 9 minutes in,0
a couple of seconds the bears are leading by 4 montgomery inside the 25 i think probably it s noticeable some of the viewers i,0
mentioned it canon moved all around to the fullback spot instead of a halfback spot in that case when he line up the fullback spot,0
there he was leading the play and he has done this on several occasions that off tackle player off guard and has provided some fine,0
blocking ahead of the ball cam it s third down and five for the bears a factor 23 out of bounds intended for 40 so,0
on 4th down here is mack percival he has already kicked 2 field goals this is a very big kick of both sides the packers,0
can prevent it are the bears can make it if the bears can make it itll take more than a touchdown to beat them concannon,0
holding at the 30 well watch from behind the goal post so first ball hits another one and succeed there s ogre and join the,0
action sent your way from county stadium in milwaukee and first of all this time he likes to flip the ball flat on the ground,0
packers immediately move up deep men of travis williams and dave hampton around the 10yard line touch by the packers and dill loop a guard,0
has it around the packer 42 yard line and lew did just what he should do rather than get excited and try to pick up,0
the ball and run with her anything else just grab it and hang on tight and lay on the ground make sure you retain possession,0
what he did bart starr is the quarterback the running backs are hampton 25 and harry williams 31 first and ten at the packer 41,0
eight minutes left in the game but besides the ball carol dale was the receiver he had and i think for an instant and he,0
got scissors he got hit one way and as he was being carried he got hit the other way and that caused him to lose,0
the ball but this was right there watch dale and and break faking by star gave star plenty of time watch the scissors one to,0
see him get hit there on from both direction there s mr butkus swivel hips of the linebacker core you happen to be on the,0
spot as usual so putt just gives the ball over to the bears and they have it first in ten at their 49 and cannon,0
has been the quarterback the entire game he s in there montgomery for a couple of yards lionel aldridge number 82 made the tackle ross,0
hot gumbo he s done some good running for the bears and preseason action there was a gain of a yard in his second and,0
nine 640 left in the game bears leading 16 deny mike hull to the 46 of green bay in the grasp of linebacker fred farr,0
53 one quick observation rayon and you wont class tall number 33 there is cookie but certainly he s a rookie in his position fullback,0
this year he s probably going to be a pleasant surprise for the bears maybe not as the niftiest runner in the league but certainly,0
is a fine blocker and if he if he can block offensively he can do a good job on pass blocking where theyll really need,0
it third and five kennan has a first down inside the 40 it watch concannon now this he had everybody down yeah just his line,0
blocking five receivers out he cant find anybody and he s being rushed they didnt figure to have too much time with all those receivers,0
out so he elects to run circles the end gets by the first group but look there s an official in the way he he,0
he just lost his balance and couldnt stay inbounds any further but he didnt make a first down a first down for the bears at,0
the factor 38 yard line with 545 left in the game the bears are leading by seven points they trailed at one time 9 to,0
nothing this is montgomery but he would made the tiger there is a gain of about eight yards for the bears let s see what,0
concannon has done now so far he s gone to the air 21 times he has completed eight one for a touchdown for 110 yards,0
all together second down and three for the bears mic hull to the outside hell be short of a first down by a little more,0
than a yard with third down coming up wood and adderley made the tackle leroy cathy comes in now for the packers hell be in,0
at a linebacking spot on third and one he replaces willie wood so there are four linebackers in now now for the pack five minutes,0
and five seconds left to play gordon to the right ross montgomery has another chicago beer first down you notice how the momentum line blocking,0
and defensive line play has swung some time back we remarked about the packers nine man line in that situation and how they smothered the,0
bears for not just to stop but a yard loss in this case now with the momentum going the bears blasted right through there for,0
the needed yardage and the first down it s a first down at the factor 26 four minutes and 20 seconds left in the game,0
montgomery in motion and he is doing a tremendous job of running ross montgomery what do you have on mister who s another little surprise,0
in here that he knows how to lower that shoulder indeed he has against the redskins on a very bad field he ran well and,0
against the dolphins acquitted himself well he picked up six yards at second and four and time is running out three minutes and 40 seconds,0
left in the game there s 16 green bay and 9 inside the 20yard line is my call third down one we can see that,0
montgomery number 22 is heavy he s 220 listen to 20 but one thing i didnt realize ray he is listed as 63 that s,0
awfully tall for their type of running he s doing worse he s with so many big people out there he looks like an averagesized,0
guy theyre hurt in a yard and a half with three minutes left to play the ball at the packer 18 very close for first,0
down this could well call for a measurement and referee pat haggerty indicates that one is coming up jack concannon meanwhile is over talking with,0
jim dooley for them about two feet away from the first time now will the bearers elect to risk a blocked field goal and cannons,0
arguing that very point he wanted to go for it he figures in it and quarterbacks are creatures of habit he made this thing with,0
with the quarterback sneaks the last two times he s tried you want to do it again but bear in mind mr percival makes the,0
field how the packers dont only have to score more than seven to win they have to score more than seven to tie so coach,0
dooley is elected to take the field though him first of all has already kicked three field goals concannon holding at the 24 he kicks,0
another one the bears lead by 1909 first of all will kickoff all sitting up on a tee this time clear over the end line,0
no chance at all for run back so mac first of all has put on quite a show for the bears if we can wed,0
like to show you that last field goal one thing that happened jack concannon is holding the ball then agajanian has been training kick holders,0
as well as kickers he doesnt have to train mac percival obviously cannon made a great save because that was a low pass of center,0
on that field goal the last time im afraid we wont be able to get it in but he just he brought it up in,0
time made a good save and a good set for the kicker mac personal harry williams out to the 26 yard line were coming up,0
to the twominute warning therell be no hunting here by the packers they want to go as fast as they can there is the twominute,0
for the packers upper 85 a new wide receiver john s phyllis has come in his foot left dollar and dale are wide to the,0
right three wide receivers in the game this is hampton out to the 41 yard line first time 140 left in the game hamton he,0
has a first down at the 46 yard line star has immediately asked for a timeout the packers i believe now have two timeouts remaining,0
these are the times and the things that preseason games are for star is moving his backfield around there im moving a couple of new,0
men around the backfield and a couple of new receivers out to various positions they are under great stress there s your time right there,0
everybody knows they have to hurry theyre doing this quick twominute drill as ray scott has told you with no huddle but everybody doesnt know,0
where to go on each call and star has to be sure theyre all in position in the right position and he is directing them,0
around eventually they will all learn this that is the ultimate goal certainly of all ball clubs there everybody learns his position particularly under times,0
of stress and star is doing a good job of moving people around in this offensive backfield particularly first and ten for the packers at,0
the fair 46 yard line as the packers have been held without a touchdown by this bear defense short of perry williams and hemsworth at,0
time and holman were flying great pressure on the star if you get a chance and we cant always show you everything wed like to,0
but if you get a chance and the bears do have the threeman rush they dont just rush three men straight ahead and fight their,0
way through five blockers theyre doing some stunting there s a threeman front up there now one man will come in the other man will,0
circle around behind it get a chance check and see if they do that this time this is stunting incomplete pass it was intended for,0
perry williams for a moment some of the players thought it might have been a backward or lateral pass it was not it is third,0
and ten star has passed eighteen times is completed nine he has had one intercepted concannon twentyone passes attempted and ten completed one for the,0
game s only touchdown 39 yards to dick borden the threeman line is made up of holmen cornish and amsler third down ten short of,0
a first down by about four yards with fourth down coming up and put 58 seconds that s the play in the game packers asked,0
for hedgy a threeman line watch see see the middleman go to the outside the outside man comes in the middle man circles around him,0
this is the way theyre confusing the blocking that s cornish right there i didnt work this time but it has worked pretty often for,0
the bears let s show bart starr over in the sidelines talking with phil bengston hands on hips and to his left bob smoker 13,0
is don horn bill heyho is in at an offensive line position for the packers and we have just that many seconds left in the,0
game the bears trailed at halftime by nine to nothing that as you can see rather nine to three that as you can see the,0
second half has been all chicago fourth and three intended for hampton kennedy linebacker dan fried was covering the intended receiver hampton once again id,0
like to clarify something here you see the penalty showing an official was right on that plane did not call her another official fifteen yards,0
away did call it and you say to yourself why didnt a close man call it because he cant see it he s in a,0
position where he couldnt see the foul but the man who s further away could see the foul that s why he calls it it,0
looks strange but it s absolutely correct automatic first down this is hampton and a fine play by buckets he got him from behind oh,0
mr butkus did was tripped three interferes right there and chip up the tag they runner at the same time that was about as good,0
a defensive play as weve seen this evening there was no gain in his second in ten thirty seconds only left to play in the,0
game short of perry william itll be third in town one of the difficulties for starring you notice he continues to throw the short stuff,0
and oftentimes to the outside short stuff again because with the threeman rush if the bears can make it effective and they have obviously other,0
men on the team and they are all dropping back so that makes that defensive backfield most congested and he has a difficult time throwing,0
the long ball there are people double covering every long receiver generally it is third and ten eb na has moved into the front three,0
frank cornish bets that went away it was intended for dave hampton but you know something there were two linebackers and a defense of fact,0
with hampton it s fourth down 18 seconds showing on the clock this bear defense has done quite a job tonight you know ray is,0
weve often remarked there s nothing that brings their defense to life like a score by the offensive ever since that long fast by concannon,0
this whole ballclub is picked up fourth down ten it was intended for dowler there were four defenders back at the goal line with him,0
it is incomplete and the bears take over with ten seconds left to play next week the bears will be in houston theyll be taking,0
one of the oilers in the astrodome there is an idea what ray scott was talking about how many defenders were around the receiver there,0
there are there are four or five white jerseys in the vicinity so the bears take over the ball first and ten a new running,0
through quarterback larry rake straws in the game and i think i spotted a new running back in there andy walton they first hear back,0
from jackson state the gun sounds and the chicago bears have scored but it s always a very cherished victory over the packers the end,0
of the game the final score chicago bears 19 the green bay packers 9 id like to make a correction on that last play of,0
the game that was not larry rick s draw that was their first year quarterback from kansas university bobby douglas who was at that position,0
on the last play of the game then on that same line ray i saw bobby douglas he only ran one play in the game,0
was over run over and shake hands with richie more well obviously this is right richie moore was on the allstar team with douglas moore,0
had a big night douglas didnt yet to play too much because cooke the other quarterback had such a big night but moore played a,0
magnificent game in that allstar game and again the final play of the game for the bears was quarterback by bobby douglas not the larry,0
rakes draw as we reported this is ray scott speaking for paul crispin and bruce roberts reminding you that the final score was the chicago,0
bears 19 the green bay packers 9 this telecast was produced by cbs television sports this is the united states armed forces radio and television,0

you dont just rent a car you run a company and by gillette platinum plus the new razor blade with the platinum alloy edge from,0
metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota it s a national football league championship game the minnesota vikings play host to the cleveland browns good morning and,0
good afternoon im ray scott pat summerall is here bruce roberts is here and by my side is paul chrisman paul how do you figure,0
today s game ray it s a little bit tough to figure but we can say there s last week the rams had some degree,0
of success in running in the first half at least against the great front 4 of minnesota but today they are facing leroy kelley probably,0
one of the finest runners in the nfl and both scott who had a great game just last week there is no question that tree,0
a cleveland s running game consists of a trap and a sweep a very simple offense but theyve made it very effective through the years,0
paul do you eliminate entirely any psychological edge that might belong to the vikings as a result of their onesided victory over the browns who,0
a few weeks ago i do eliminate it ray because what it looks good to the vikings might make the browns just that much matter,0
this time okay paul will join pat summerall and cbs control in just a moment as the nfl today continues in 1965 we developed an,0
experimental blade called eb7 stainless steel with a plastic coating today weve developed a better blade not eb8 9 or 10 it s eb 11,0
with a new platinum alloy edge that s harder than stainless and more durable than chrome to shave you not just cleaner but smoother eb,0
11 we call it to let platinum plus the blade youve always wanted and more over the years we had herds have learned what it,0
is to travel to be lost to be without a place to stay or know where to get a decent meal so as a company,0
weve trained our people to help and given them means with which to help weve taught them that running you afford is just where they,0
begin this of course is the 50th year professional football and as you look back at the history of this great game it seems that,0
each period each ten years was dominated by one or two teams if you look back at the 30s it was the bears the giants,0
and the redskins after the war the battles between the cardinals and the eagles in the early 50s it was the cleveland browns and the,0
detroit lions later in the 50s of course those memorable years between the baltimore colts and the new york giants then as you come to,0
the 60s with a possible interruption here there from the cleveland browns the 60s belong to the green bay packers join us now as we,0
go back and look at just a few of the highlights of those first 50 years in 1920 george halas found that the nfl and,0
his coach of the chicago bears he gave the game its first great superstar and red grange ran wild in 1933 george preston marshall won,0
his fight for an nfl championship game matching the winners of the western conference and the top team in the east fittingly hollis s bears,0
were the western champs their foes the new york giants and on a cold day in wrigley field they defeated the giants 23 to 21,0
the same two teams met in the 1934 game unable to find footing or success on the slippery field the giants trail 13 three late,0
in the game but the team s trainer spent the third quarter in search of tennis shoes he found them and with solid footing beneath,0
them the giants scored 27 points in the final quarter to win 32:13 in 1937 a rookie named bog quarterback the washington redskins to an,0
nfl title as the bears fell beneath swinging sammy s arm 28 to 21 but the decade still belong to the bears and the giants,0
who had struggled for seven years both teams stalking a dynasty by 1940 neither team had a clear edge but the bears had the stubborn,0
mine of george halas on their side with sid luckman his quarterback alice drew diagrams and his bears followed them to perfection as they routed,0
the redskin 73 to nothing in the 1940 title game it still stands as the most onesided game in championship history chicago and the tea,0
were to go on to dominate most of the decade but in 1948 and 1949 the philadelphia eagles took up the balance by winning backtoback,0
championships for the first time in nfl history with steve van buren leading the charge philadelphia seemed well prepared for the 15 but the cleveland,0
browns and their great quarterback otto graham came onto the scene in 1950 a superb passer in respected leader graham led his team to a,0
divisional championship in each of his 10 years as quarterback by 1946 his team had played in six nfl championship games and won three of,0
them ran and the browns were a sensation in the victims they might never have lost had it not been for the detroit lions and,0
bobby lane lane had away with men it was a commanding leader gaining both the respect and fear of all those who played for it,0
he passed a curious jinx over the browns as the lines beat cleveland in the 50 to 53 and 57 title game the most famous,0
game of the decade matched johnny unitas in the colts against feared for a bank killer sam huff and the giants this 1958 championship has,0
been called the greatest game of a play for the score tied at the end of regulation play a suddendeath overtime was begun the first,0
in championship history alan ameche went in for the touchdown and the baltimore fans went wild america had a new sport title and the game,0
of football was ready to blast into the television age of the sixties it was time for vince lombardi to charm the football world and,0
beat everybody inside the fakirs completely dominated the decade playing in six nfl championship games and winning fiber lombardi was the king and his kingdom,0
was never on better display than in 1967 when the pack played dumbest incredible cold incredible facts and a block by jerry kramer the pack,0
wins for the third year in a row lombardi becomes a legend today the browns and the vikings battle for power the winner may start,0
a new dynasty but the plaka legend will be high to overcome and now well take a look at some more recent history and well,0
be back with the last game the browns and the vikings played in just a moment as the nfl today continues remember tom harmon the,0

get more that s all it was midseason the last time these two teams met like now cleveland had just come off a big win,0
over dallas that time the score was 42 to 10 last week the browns beat dallas thirty eight to 14 when they came to metropolitan,0
stadium before cleveland lost fifty one two three let s take a look joe kapp warmed up and wonder bill nelson seems smooth and whether,0
his vaughn was on but the vikings were perfect led by the purple front for the vikings defense put nelson through a meat grinder and,0
out came a tender lag and when the front 4letter it was only so the secondary could make the cleveland receivers forget about catching the,0
ball as good as the defense was joe captain the offense were better captain wide receiver gene washington number 84 put on a stunning exhibition,0
when it was over washington had caught seven passes for 119 yards and three touchdowns all in the first half on one play cap simply,0
pointed out to washington where he was going to throw the ball incredibly he was not covered and the vikings jumped were 27 freely but,0
it wasnt all passes as the viking runners tore through the brown defense cleveland runners could gain only 42 yards rushing all afternoon and a,0
total of only eight first down the vikings scored the first nine times they hand the ball and punted only once but the best show,0
was still cap and washington and what is becoming his expected style capped rolled out and then looked the other way getting ready to jump,0
another touchdown pass to washington but it all ended the vikings were on the topside of a fifty one to three score the biggest rout,0
of the year and the worst in browns history it was a day the browns will certainly have in the back of their minds when,0
they take the field today well see how the browns and vikings got into today s championship game in just a moment as the nfl,0
today continues commended you were new in town you see im just thinking why because i want our savings where theyre safe you would happen,0

bank and do it all for you how can you tell one for one thing if the place you save cant offer you a checking,0
account it s not a fullservice bank whatever your banking needs look for this symbol of service a week ago paul crispin and ray scott,0
were here in minnesota watching the rams play the minnesota vikings the next day jack buck and i were in dallas where dallas was favored,0
over the cleveland browns let s take a look at some of the highlights of that game first time cleveland had the volley were forced,0
to punt don cockroft got out of a high short punt bob hayes had signaled for fair catch the linemen down underneath never saw the,0
ball the ball bounced off a field right cleveland recovered and you could almost see dallas wilt at that point bill nelson went right to,0
work to warfield who had a great day this in the early minutes of the first quarter nelson again this time dumped right over the,0
middle two more in and this sets up the first cleveland touchdown and here is the touchdown the one that gave cleveland a 7 having,0
lead a block by kelly in front and both scott gets in he s their new fullback he replaced ron johnson nelson again in action,0
he fakes the end sweep to kelly a maneuver that he used throughout the day he finds more and again it seems it more and,0
always has big days against dallas nelson spectacular throughout the day this time the warfield at the 1 cleveland was penalized 5 yards because of,0
backfield in motion after this so now theyre back at the 6 they put this play in the day before the game nelson to his,0
tight end morin 89 we even got the vault in the closing seconds of the first half after dallas had to give it up nelson,0
fired strike again this time to warfield in the middle cleveland throws to a wide variety of receivers if youll see morin clears the area,0
nelson throws down the middle to both scott scott fumbles then it s recovered by their offensive send center fred hoagland they got a field,0
goal just after that from don cockroft and at halftime it was 17 nothing the cleveland browns over dallas and dallas fans hoped hoped that,0
something could take place at halftime that might get their team back on the right track such was not to be the case in the,0
early moments of the third quarter craig morton who had a tough day for dallas back to pass must be excellent coverage fine rush by,0
cleveland and houston intercepts and rambles down the sidelines some 33 yards before they can get him down nelson went right back to work he,0
lost none of his sharpness at halftime screen pass to kelly behind excellent blocking down in front kelly almost got in now from the end,0
zone the second touchdown of the day by cleveland fullback both scott that s bob lilley coming across in front of him and that should,0
give you some indication of the strength that scott possesses nelson on a draw de leroy kelly a fine block in front by gary collins,0
number 86 as you can see on corneal green that s just at the end of the third quarter beginning the fourth quarter kelly gets,0
his touchdown that made it cleveland 31 dallas 7 at that point this is the place we told you that theyd like to work on,0
cleveland walsim their intercepts 88 yards later cleveland has its 37th and 38th point was done knock offs extra point is good that s how,0
it was at the cotton bowl in dallas pretty much your onesided affair 38 to 14 the final score the day before it was different,0
here wasnt it paul fat you had a lot of spectacular plays a lot of running up and down the field a lot of long,0
passes all that spectacular type of football it was a kind of a grind amount football game here in the stadium at minnesota and here,0
are the highlights here this is joke cap throwing to washington to the outside who falls and puts out a bound there the field incidentally,0
was not frozen but the field around was right at the edge of the sideline here s cap again and watched this washington once again,0
on a crossover and now kept throwing off the wrong foot again as he so often does watch him now hits washington who keeps both,0
feet inbounds and that s the one that took them down to their first touchdown this is osburgh he this is called second effort watch,0
him now hell roll it applause where did that end zone he does that s a touchdown right there we are at the half now,0
and despite the fact that we have shown you viking highlights the vikings went into the dressing room behind 17 to 7 so we better,0
pick up the second half highlight here and this is joe kapp going to washington watch hell make the catch get up to run and,0
party hit him and is penalized for doing so quite a bit of discussion on this play i watch cap back to throw and this,0
is why he is so very valuable he cannot find the receiver watch what he does down to the oneyard line and puts him in,0
great scoring position here s osman again watch him hit hard into this end zone now being led by bill brown in he goes here,0
s osman again i watch him roll here he stopped they need a first down i need a couple of yards he stopped apparently cold,0
he rolls on picks up about four yards in a very vital first down here s cap again now taking him into scoring position once,0
again cant find a receiver watch what he does fine runner he s directing traffic here now it s telling the blockers out ahead of,0
them to help out down to the 4 yard line watch the blocking you can barely see it in the left corner of your screen,0
cap on a roll out and he gets great blocking ahead of him nobody touches until he just gets to the goal and it s,0
too late there this is roman gabriel now karl eller knocking him into the end zone for safety were going to show you that in,0
slow motion mr eller 81 this great defensive end watch him go by bob brown a fine offensive blocker and pickoff gabriel right here and,0
he s heading backwards knock him into the end zone and those were the last two points that the minnesota vikings scored and pat that,0
s the way it went from here two entirely different type of games paul and ill take a stab at evaluating these two teams in,0
just a moment as the nfl today continues when you travel for a living you travel when it s good for your business not when,0
it s good for you while renting fords over the years we had heard have come to understand the plight of the traveling businessman and,0
instead of just offering you sympathy weve actually devised a number of ways to help you see it hurts you dont just rent a car,0
you rent a company search no more the quest for the ultimate blade is over gillette introduces platinum plus the played with an edge of,0
gillette astonishing new platinum alloy platinum plus harder than stainless more durable than chrome to shave you not just cleaner but with more comfort than,0
any blade in history so much platinum plus per blade youve always wanted whoa paul and i have worked at our own rating system on,0
these two teams the cleveland offense against the viking offense the viking defense against the brown defense we use the scale of 10/10 would be,0
the maximum obviously both of these teams would have to rank very high since they are in the championship game and because paul has been,0
with the vikings a lot more than i have i think this is a fifth game he s covered of theirs ive asked him to,0
take the viking defense ill take the brown defense so paul the defense first pad i think we should mention here that sure rockman does,0
a very workmanlike job as a cornerback here kesakhian kraus are fine safety men crossed the free safety man and he does a good job,0
of playing the ball all the time which he should do mac bay a note from the scouting book is this that he likes to,0
play back a little bit he will give you a little of the short stuff but he doesnt like to let you throw the long,0
one on him and he has intercepted a lot of passes this year because people have tried to get behind him we rank these people,0
about eight and a half winston and hildenburg do an excellent job of playing the screens as well as the runs they are fine outside,0
linebackers warwick weve mentioned so often the middle linebacker only has time to play the passers eyes in certain cases and he does this very,0
well when we get to the front four this is where i think the vikings will hang their head and that is that great pass,0
rush mr eller we referred to as the chairman of the board and he certainly is these other people are just about as good we,0
cannot give them a ten ranking because the rams did a pretty good job of running on these two men the first half at least,0
but not so well the second half but there s our total for the viking defense and let s have a little bit on the,0
brown design span this is the brown defensive unit that dallas coach tom landry described last week as being the one that would bend but,0
would not break last week against dallas they didnt even bend the front for not very spectacular certainly not as much publicized as the front,0
for for minnesota the outstanding members i think youd have to say would be the right hand jack gregory and the left defensive tackle walter,0
johnson the other two snider and kenickie as they say give you a good game every week the linebackers dale lindsay the middle man started,0
on the outside at the beginning of the year then they moved him to the middle linebacker position and that seemed to be the move,0
that sort of solidified the brown defense they are very active all three of the linebackers get back very deep and help out the the,0
men in the secondary on task coverage of the three houston is the best blitzer the secondary they say every secondary every defensive unit needs,0
a killer one headhunter so called of that group it would be e returns a left cornerback he s the one that sticks you the,0
leading pass interceptors mike howell who s the free safety he intercepted six passes on the year the place that everybody tries to work is,0
on the rookie the lone rookie in the secondary that would be walt sumner the right cornerback without success in recent weeks he picked one,0
off against dallas last week returned at 88 yards we give them an eight in all three categories for a total of 24 so the,0
vikings there have a three point advantage as far as were concerned now let s go back to the viking offense and your appraisal paul,0
and pat we will start with the two outside man gary had a big week last week against the deacon a big game i should,0
say did a fine job all of us are fine working like tackle im speaking mainly of pass protection now these two guards are pretty,0
good pulling guards on the running plays tingle hoff has made allpro and is particularly adept at picking up the strays on the blitzing maneuver,0
by the linebackers when you get over to the receivers here washington and henderson of two of the same type they are both tall men,0
they do not run like bob hayes but they are pretty fast they get down the field well and they have great jumping ability believe,0
it or not this is a real asset in their favor many coaches have said that beasley is really the bread and butter guy of,0
this three i had one coach telling me we contain these two men pretty well but beasley is the guy that beat us we get,0
over to the running backs they are the same as the entire biking team they are not spectacular they just get the job done the,0
same can be said of joe kapp who is not a classic passer is not anything all he does is win and that s the,0
way this ballclub has gone all year we had up to 25 and a half of the viking offense pat the brown offense spectacular i,0
think is an adjective you could use to describe him the offensive line shaft rant dmarie hoagland hickerson and clark is as fine a unit,0
as youll find anywhere the two tackles clark and shaft rath both are very quick they can get out in front of leroy kelly on,0
the quick pitches and the two guards the same thing can be said for them tomorrow and hickerson hickerson probably the best pulling guard in,0
football anywhere he has been for a long time he s lost none of his quickness none of his speed the receivers again i think,0
as a unit they are probably as fine as anybody in professional football warfield the most dangerous i think collins coming off of his one,0
of his finest years he caught 54 passes more in the tight end is classic in size six four and 250 and he has the,0
speed and strength to take a ball out of a crowd and get away from the tacklers the running backs leroy kelly i think enough,0
has already been said about him he is probably one of the finest in the business but you ask any of the members of the,0
brown team whether it be offense defense special teams coaches whatever theyll tell you the man that s pulled the whole club together is bill,0
nelson and his performance against dallas last week i guess could be subscribed as spectacular 27 and a half points then we give the running,0
backs in nelson nine the receivers nine and a half the offensive line nine so we get 27 and a half we beat you by,0
two there if you total this up youll see that the vikings only have a onepoint advantage as far as were concerned over the cleveland,0
browns yet in regular season paul minnesota 151 or three how the excitement it s just the way this ballclub has been all year pat,0
as we have mentioned theyre not spectacular they do the job one plus i think we should mention for the browns offense leroy kelly a,0
greatest one of the great runners of the league also a very clutch pass receiver he has fine hands and does a great job and,0
has pulled them out of the hole many times it looks like the brown offense is going to go against the viking defense in particularly,0
these people youve heard so much about that front or course says you think about it there s so many intangible things the weather and,0
then of course you cant forget about the leading scorer and the league fred cox who scored 121 points the most ever for a kicker,0
that has to be a definite plus for minnesota well be back at metropolitan stadium in just a moment as the nfl today continues there,0
s no telling what youll run into enough highways these days but this moves superval tired as firestone s exclusive triplestrength construction strong cords for,0
extra long strong sidewalls for extra long mile strong bonding for extra long mileage firestone s new wide oval tire test after test shows it,0
"can give you up to 40,000 miles if youre a sensible and lawabiding driver even 50,000 miles and more get super built for extra long",0
mileage at firestone the mileage specialist bruce roberts down here at the field of metropolitan stadium and if there is such a thing it is,0
pleasantly cold the temperature is 9 degrees above the winds out of the northwest at 10 miles an hour and the sun is shining brightly,0
as far as the condition of the field is concerned dick eriksen and his ground crew here have done a truly remarkable job immediately after,0
last week s viking ran game they covered the complete surface including the end zones with a 2inch thick fiberglass blanket that in turn was,0
covered by a tarp and then blowers were brought in to see if the ground did not freeze and as i write this as of,0
this moment you can see the flame throwers in the background theyre working at it so we have fairly ideal conditions but by halftime the,0
ground might freeze and some changes will have to be made that s the situation as of this moment well be ready for the start,0
of today s nfl championship game between the cleveland browns and the minnesota vikings after this pause for station identification the minnesota vikings and the,0
cleveland browns battle for high stakes for the winner the nfl championship and a trip to the super bowl stay tuned for the action on,0
cbs cbs television sports presents the national football league championship ruff you by standard oil division american oil company will remind you that you expect,0
more from standard and you get it and by new through silver cigarettes with or without menthol and by four who brings you better ideas,0
for 1970 well paul as far as the weather is concerned we have sunshine in case the sunshine should disappear here at bloomington minnesota the,0
lights are turned on the field i think it s safe to say to echo what bruce robert said is that it is in as,0
good a condition as it is possible to be at this time of year in this part of the country would you agree i agree,0
ray i dont think were going to see any snow today i think it s going to remain very cold because of the lack of,0
cloud cover and there is a possibility the field might freeze about the half and if it does it might change the rush of that,0
great front for minnesota the officials for our game today the referee is tom bell the umpire joe connell the head linesman george murphy jack,0
fetty is the line judge ralph vandenberg the back judge fritz graph the field judge there are alternate here today as well bernie almond and,0
bruceton lesen so well be ready for the start of today s game in just a moment when you the word the hawaiians have been,0
reading united airlines asking us to their little corner of the world for 23 since then tonight it has blown more people to the items,0
from more cities than any other everywhere and that s why we caught our little corner of the world the world of united to prove,0
that maverick is the simple machine we asked five stewardesses to put back together they proved it maverick the simple machine still just 1995 when,0
everything else is going up the cleveland browns defensive unit has been introduced and you will judge by the roar of this capacity crowd or,0
yourself the minnesota vikings offensive unit is being introduced nick tingle half of nebraska jim valon of southern california milk sunday of minnesota brady alderman,0
from detroit ronnie ra of southern california have all been introduced michigan state s jean washington was split em tight end john beasley washington from,0
michigan state beasley of california dave osborne number 41 you saw a moment ago from north dakota bill brown the fullback from illinois john henderson,0
the flanker from michigan and the quarterback there s henderson number 80 and the quarterback joke captain i would say the calling out of his,0
name a book the greatest bit of applause we have heard so far today head coach blanton collier of the browns was introduced head coach,0
but granted the minnesota vikings the cleveland browns have won four national football league championships they have appeared in ten nfl championship games in fact,0
they have appeared in three of the last five their last championship came in 1964 they were on the losing end in championship games in,0
1965 and in 1968 joe kapp i think that over these last few weeks paul chrisman our sports following public of this country has learned,0
to know a lot about this young man he does everything the wrong way you know as we said all he does is win and,0
that s im sure that s getting a little tiresome to hear but it s just the way he plays ball he apparently has a,0
fine delivery here but you see him in the ball game throwing with his right foot forward and his right foot sideways and every other,0
way but he gets the ball of the receivers which is what concen he gets it there on time referee tom bell indicating the minnesota,0
vikings have won the toss and have elected to receive the temperature we will repeat is nine above zero the wind is out of the,0
northwest at 12 miles per hour the playing field and again and again we will say at the playing field as of right now is,0
in good condition a comparison with last week when the vikings played the los angeles rams here snow actually had crept on to just the,0
edges of the playing field necessitating sideline markers of a red like dust well now the same red dust is being used today but the,0
snow is well away from either sideline so i dont think paul will have any problem determining whether a player is in or out of,0
bounds we know i dont think we will either raiders if that red line shows up better than anything and also we remind you again,0
there are flags intermittently about every ten yards along the field and dont be surprised if you see one and a ball player rolls out,0
of bounds you might think automatically it is the goal line it is not there s a flag right there there all along the sideline,0
on both sides just in case of any tough weather they may need these the flag raising is being taken care of by a combined,0
color guard from the us army and marine corps the biking band directed by mr ralph mendenhall will play the anthem the singing here will,0
be led by mr charles wood so our players are at attention and we all join in the singing of our national anthem yeah wow,0
right oh haha so the minnesota vikings make their first appearance ever in a national football league championship game with the exception of nine firstyear,0
men all of these cleveland browns were on the squad last year that lost in the championship game to the baltimore colts don khakhra tees,0
it up for cleveland deep number 40 charlie west number 26 clint jones so the talking and the writing are over it s down to,0
the play were glad youre with us like national football league championship at bloomington minnesota charlie west of the gate to the 30 first phantom,0

is prohibited caps since henderson 82 the left washington 84 to the right from the viking 30 person cap intended for henderson broken down by,0
walt sumner you had a chance to see the minnesota vikings offensive unit most of them at least so right now as the vikings are,0
second in ten from their 30 let s set up the cleveland defense for you up front for cleveland gregory 81 kenickie 69 johnson 71,0
and snide oh 88 the three linebackers in the middle lyndsey 51 flanked by garlington 50 and houston 82 second and 10 minnesota bill brown,0
four yards 34 yard line lindsey stops him and now the brown deep men at the right corner you saw him break down the first,0
pass thrown walt s under 29 at the left corner is 12year veteran number 40 eric barnes mike howell 34 and ernie kellerman 24 round,0
out the cleveland secondary for minnesota third down six from the viking 34 to the right henderson to the left washington growl first out linebackers,0
jim houston made the tackle but the vikings have a burst out take a little look at it now this is a draw type place,0
he have wait for the ball to be brought back to him that gives a trap man time to get out there and make his,0
block and here s the cut as he gets to the line of scrimmage this moves slightly to the outside good gainer result gain of,0
nine first and ten vikings minnesota 43 to the wide side the right is henderson more washington he was in 24 yard line well give,0
you a picture this all alone now watch him washington you will see his feeder and even though his body may not as he leans,0
oh he s still heat in all the way it looked like his body was slightly out of bounds but he did have both feet,0
any edits he caught the ball in bonds all the way as it turned out so cap to washington first down cleveland 24 yard line,0
gain 33 yards washington left henderson right brown he s inside the funny mike howell of the secondary 34 walter johnson number 71 mainly responsible,0
for stopping that play but the ball 18 a 19 yard line of cleveland it is second down and four and a half our game,0
is just underway as we look along the sidelines at the minnesota vikings bennett washington laughing oh anderson right osbourne he s inside the ten,0
you know that s the way osman has run the entire season he s always got that second effort watch him now he looks like,0
he stopped there s a little crossbuck move there hed hit bang rolls keeps going watch how much more yardage he picks up after he,0
was apparently stopped there s some real effort sumner prevented a touchdown perhaps he was the last man it s first and goal at the,0
cleveland seven after three and a half minutes away henderson s incomplete depending he responds we got our first look at the elements the elements,0
in this case end zone although they claim it is not frozen this is apparently a little tougher than the playing field henderson try to,0
do a little maneuver there started at the end and tried to cut quickly and go to the outside and he slipped a little bit,0
he didnt get any ground on the defensive man at all they were both kind of skating around there as they ran through the end,0
zone by the way there was some doubt about footwear but they are wearing regular football shoes second and goal at the cleveland seven for,0
the vikings growl growl chap i believe wanted to give the ball to phil brown watch it s a busted play this is the best,0
bus in the world six points he ran into each other he s supposed to go off tackle and the defense moved to take brown,0
instead kept right up the middle and you see what happened six points fred cox with kraus holding will try for the seven point a,0
penalty marker is down outside cleveland it s declined the extra point stands at seven nothing minnesota will be back with the vikings kickoff in,0
just a woman see you later get out leg huh yeah yeah live it up you guys well i guess it s just you and,0
me buddy yeah me my hamster me my wings oh we got a real good thing feel to taste when it comes to keeping a,0
guy good company there s almost nothing like a winston one taste and itll be you and your winston stick yeah winston king or super,0
king you get a real good thing so the vikings go 66 yards and score on a play that was not intended to be a,0
seven yard run by kat cox kicks off deep or morrison and scott morrison just got his hands on it in the end zone for,0
a touchback but a viking was there a split second after morrison covered that ball touch back ground start from the brown 2011 oh three,0
left first quarter in the vikings lead by seven to nothing in their first nfl championship game ever starting for cleveland in the backfield bill,0
nelson is the quarterback number 16 running backs are kelly 44 and scott 35 kelly four yards carl eller number 81 here against mike clark,0
the right tackle eller bypasses is hit by two people still split some makes the tackle but for a four yard gain second down six,0
cleveland warfield 42 left collins 86 to the right nelson both scott first out 38yard line carl eller made the tackle nelson during the regular,0
season completed 54 percent of his passes he threw 23 touchdown passes id say in the latter part of the season particularly last month we,0
have seen more and more of that last type of way it s like a screen to lineman get out there ahead of but it,0
s just a quick swing fest to either side first and ten cleveland at the brown 38 intended for laura he collided with linebacker wally,0
hilga norwich was back there it was warwick that ran into morin as the past reached moren second down ten cleveland 944 left first quarter,0
vikings lead 7 nothing joke cat ran seven yards for a touchdown he intended that bill brown have the ball it didnt work out that,0
way to the right collins to the left warfield tight end lauren is on the left side both scott 43yard line alan page made the,0
tackle watch hickerson now were going to show you this clegg and im sorry were not going back with this one on saturday january 24th,0
cbs will bring you a nighttime special harlem globetrotters the road to mexico they always delight young and old alike middle of lemon the crown,0
prince of basketball meadowlark well be there that s the harlem globetrotters road to mexico january 24 on cbs 3rd down by cleveland both scott,0
s the intended receiver bill nelson hits for the sidelines as for cleveland it is fourth and five 902 left to play first quarter vikings,0
lead 7 nothing charlie west number 40 bob grim number 27 are the deep men and for what it s worth are in a terrific,0
sun field in this first quarter the sun is directly behind the kicker bob coming from inside the 30 fair catch west 24 yard line,0
up in the foot with the score the viking seven and the browns nothing let s pause for a moment mechanics have a ticklish problem,0
with a mattone it does part of their job so as mechanics they shouldnt like it but as customers they do who knows better what,0
it does for your engine standard oil dealers welcome mechanics in strict confidence we wont tell if you dont the one you like best just,0
"got better so could your custom widespread poly glass tires 38,000 miles and a set of tires is quite a few miles i dont id",0
"say go across the united states two or three times either and with 38,000 miles on them i wouldnt be afraid to go across two",0
or three more times if real grip and tire on wet pavement if it doesnt say goodyear it cant be poly glass so went 66,0
yards for a touchdown after the opening kickoff and lead seven nothing our first intent at their own 20 ball cap still has it or,0
washington 35 yard line of cleveland with walt sumner defending it is incomplete im trying to recall paul did camp mainly throw out of that,0
little rollout last week against the rams yes he did quite often ray and in fact in our highlights from last week we showed him,0
whirling out there and throwing that first pass to washington down to the two yard line which took him in for their first touchdown on,0
this last play washington faked a little sideline it just took a jog step to the outside and kept right on going camp through down,0
the middle of the field i dont know whether it s against the wind or what but washington had to circle in and couldnt reach,0
it second down 10 minnesota from the viking 44 brown practically no game ron schneider number 88 mainly responsible for fighting up the play the,0
cleveland defensive unit gregory kenickie johnson snyder the front four there was a gain of a yard for minnesota it is third and nine at,0
the viking 25 824 left to play first quarter minnesota leads 7 nothing and caps ins henderson to the left and washington to the right,0
oh washington if defender fell down what s down what theyve now kept going back i dont believe youll be able to see washington maneuver,0
but the defender did flip and he turned to cut over the middle see how all alone he is here no one within 10 15,0
yards of it thank you see he s kind of trotting here he really isnt airing out because he has all the room here it,0
s barnes spell down around midfield and so now the vikings lead 13 to nothing and fred cox with paul krause holding will try to,0
make it 14 753 left to play first quarter it is 40 nothing minnesota well be back with the vikings kickoff in just a woman,0
when you spend your life working hard it s something you like you learn to take every little bit of goodness that comes along youve,0
earned it and you know you really dont get any second chances because you only go around once in life so you got to grab,0
for all that gusto you can even in the beer you drink i settle for less pirata schlitz youre on a beer joe cap has,0
completed two of five passes jean washington has certainly lived up to his reputation as one of the great deep receivers the vikings have a,0
to finality that kick is outofbounds and will be a 5yard penalty against the vikings the head coach of the cleveland browns is referred to,0
over and over again in descriptive phrases like mildmannered the word gentlemanly is used and certainly id have to say fall he s one of,0
the truly softspoken head coaches ive ever known but also one of the real greats in this coaching profession incidentally among other people he taught,0
a young man named bud grant as he started him off and there is bud grant the head coach of the minnesota vikings so now,0
the vikings will kick from their 35 yard line deep again our morrison 26 and scott 35 both scott for the 25 yard line bob,0
grimm number 27 bulldogging to the ground first and ten cleveland at the brown 25 we have just about reached the midway point of the,0
first quarter those kickoffs that you saw one out of bonds and the other that nearly went out of bounds on the opening kickoff were,0
not accidents they are kicking the kickers kicking to the open space in the field attempting to get the ball over there on a line,0
drive nelson has warfield to the left and gary collins for the right kelly and scott for the running backs oh that it s down,0
by allen page number 88 it will be second in 10 for the third year in a row cbs will televise a national hockey game,0
of the week that starts on sunday january 11 super bowl day on that day the nhl series will kick off with the defending champion,0
montreal canadiens taking on the new york rangers at 12:30 eastern time super sunday next sunday on cbs second down 10 cleveland de rooy kelly,0
from behind linebacker wally hell confirm the left line back the right linebacker of the minnesota vikings and that was all hillenburg there because he,0
played off a blocker had a good lead on him he still played him off well made the taxes you must also know if youre,0
watching it this really puts the job on the offensive line of cleveland now because being behind 14 points in the first quarter obviously nelson,0
will have to go to the air more often than he would like so it would change his game plan and also the defense vikings,0
can afford to gamble a little more now it is third and 10 there was no gain on the last play broken down at the,0
39 yard line by winston and kazuki and except for their collision on a pass intended for colin and put well it is now 4th,0
and 10 as takraw is cutting from inside the 15 to grim and west you west at the 37 and that s all tonight on,0
the network of the stars cbs a very special starstudded night for the entire family and sullivan starts off the evening with a new singing,0
sensation oliver roy rogers and dale evans will be there and the newest dolly on broadway phyllis diller glen campbell s goodtime hour will follow,0
with music and dancing an allstar show then the mission impossible team will join forces and will bring you a special chilling adventure of a,0
bizarre mystery that might be the show of the year tonight on cbs first down viking viking 37 bill brown whistled dead at the 42,0
and a half or three yard line as snide oh and houston made the stop the vikings are leading by 14 to nothing having scored,0
the first two times they had the ball we have word now from the sidelines that the playing surface is still generally good there are,0
a few spots that are frozen and as a result of course are slippery brown picked up five yards second down five at the viking,0
42 bill brown and he loses ron snide oh the defensive end number 88 made that find offensive play and for the vikings itll be,0
third and now a little more than five you know just thinking giving you the thinking of the quarterback their normal circumstance the quarterback in,0
this situation would have a little bit of a tendency to be just a little cozy on this down because everybody s expecting it fast,0
i dont think you need worry about joe kev doesnt matter what the score is he s all out all the way henderson is to,0
the wide side the left oh dave osborne penalty marker down a loss back to the 38 yard line and ernie kellerman of the secondary,0
number 24 with help mainly the man who stopped the play but there was a penalty marker as the play was developing 420 left to,0
play first quarter the vikings lead 14 nothing a clipping penalty the browns decline they want the ball it will be fourth down fourth down,0
and about ten the punter for minnesota is bob lee and we have worked from the sidelines that that clipping was on henderson bob lee,0
punts rhys morrison 35 yard line he and leroy kelly were the deep man and he feel that that one like an outfielder fall forget,0
indeed and also i noticed his white shoes ray i think those are tennis shoes but i cant be sure yet so the browns down,0
by 14 nothing four minutes nine seconds left to play in the first quarter cleveland first and ten at the cleveland 34 and a half,0
wide right collins left warfield tight end morin on the right side roli kelly for the 37 he ran into alan page let s set,0
the biking defense for you now youve had a chance to watch their offense most of the first quarter the viking defense the front for,0
marshall 70 page 88 larson 77 and eller 81 the three minnesota linebackers are hilgendorf fe8 warwick in the middle 59 at his left roy,0
winston number 64 cleveland second down eight at the cleveland 37 kelly humble watch hill greenberg number 58 now backing up here he s gone,0
back to protect now he comes in to make the tackle here s the fumble he s hit you see when he s hit the,0
second time on the elbow from the rear that s when the ball popped out paul krause we believe is responsible for the recovery first,0
and 10 minnesota at the cleveland 43 osbourne about the 39yard line pinned down by the to cleveland tackles kenickie and johnson gained three between,0
two and three second down seven two and a half minutes left to play in the first quarter cap scored on a seven yard run,0
and then threw a touchdown pass of 75 yards to washington as a defender ii rich barnes fell down bill brown he s down to,0
the 35 yard line where it will be a third and about to dale lindsay the middle linebacker number 51 stop the minnesota running back,0
in a way he has a decision here he has almost two and a half almost three yards ago which is a long way to,0
run on so you think he might go to the air by the same token if he wishes he has two downs to make this,0
because he would be around the 34 yard line which if he punted would almost be back there in the end zone so you know,0
six of one half a dozen their third and key maas born first second effort husband that s the way it is bounce keep going,0
he s done it all season number 41 dave osborne a fifth year running back from north dakota he s a six footer and 205,0
and that short run gave the vikings of 1st and 10 at the cleveland 30 with a minute and a couple of seconds left to,0
play in the first quarter and wally hilgendorf humble in addition to forcing the fumble brown oh what a reception committee jack gregory number 81,0
met brown at the line of scrimmage result no gain and maybe a bruise middle he was met at the past and when youre going,0
forward full speed and suddenly going backward this is quite a joke he got it saw the brown defense sorely tested here in the first,0
quarter which has 25 seconds remaining and the clock running the brown defense digs in viking second in 10030 fortyeight the 18 yard line pass,0
is complete jean washington first down and there was needle threading if ive ever seen it and that s the end of the first quarter,0
with the score the minnesota vikings 14 we know a snowball vacation on united airlines to winnow tao great skiing great everything action swinging and,0
the snowball runs from december to may come fly united airlines to the exciting world of renotahoe a world that makes for most of its,0
days and it s night call your travel agent or united come on have a snowball were at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota that paul,0
kristen pat summerall and bruce roberts this is ray scott jean washington who just left the game has grant free passes for 120 yards including,0
one for 75 and a td he is replaced now by bob grim number 27 joe kapp is had a huddle with the viking coaching,0
staff it is first in 10 minnesota at the cleveland 18 as we start the second quarter grim to the left henderson for the right,0
bill brown penalty marker down johnson lindsay and kenickie stop the play 15 yard infraction against the minnesota vikings the ball comes back to the,0
minnesota for the cleveland 32 yard line holding signaled by referee tommy bell and there is jean washington and now moving back this far the,0
obvious thing to do is come up with the past the defense also knows the obvious thing to do is to come up with the,0
class so what do you come up with this is a draw type situation the screen time as well as the passing situation it s,0
first and 24 inside the 30yard line john garlington wrestles cap out of bounds there will be a gain of about three or four yards,0
and that s why cleveland is in this championship game they had that was a screen call they had it well covered and there is,0
absolutely no place to unload the ball of the screen man is covered here s beasley right here now he s drifted out in the,0
flat and you see theyre a couple of men in the vicinity there s no place to throw this ball so finally he has to,0
throw a block and joe kapp runs with it but the wise thing to do is not to throw because a screen pass must be,0
thrown softly and it s easily picked off if anybody s in the area it s second and 20 at the 28 and washington is,0
back in dave osborne to the 22 yard line and it will be third and 14 as jack gregory and jim houston teamed up to,0
stop dave osborne the second quarter is just underway and the vikings are leading by 14 to nothing the vikings took the opening kickoff and,0
took it all the way joe kapp scoring from seven yards and then when a defender had the misfortune to fall down gene washington caught,0
a 75 yard touchdown pass henderson is wide right on third and 14 henderson defending was ernie kellerman ray that is the exact see the,0
shadows there that the exact corner of the sun field i believe that ball was in range i will see it well take another look,0
now weve got him here see when he turns if the ball is in reach and look like he lost it he s got a,0
good lead on the defender here there s a question whether he could have reached it with a jump or not but it looked like,0
was within reach but i dont think he saw the thing the league s leading scorer fred cox who kicked 26 of 37 field goals,0

plays as draws it is a third and three for cleveland at the minnesota 48 yard line intended for colin s incomplete at the forty,0

it see him throw back to his left and here the interception is pulled in now ray scott said a flag drop i believe an,0
official right here dropped his cap right after this to indicate where the ball right fall there was no penalty first and 10 vikings viking,0
33 john henderson defending ear it s barnes it s close to a first down watch anderson on a classic sideline pattern and note how,0
quickly the ball comes in after he makes his cut this is the secret of all this passing right there before the defensive man can,0
recover with timing like that it s pretty difficult to defend against there will be a measurement here for the down as wide receiver john,0
henderson grabs off the joe cap pass during the regular season henderson caught 34 passes five four touchdowns collins is the leading receiver in this,0
game today based on regular season statistics receiving 54 11 four touchdowns warfield caught 10 touchdown passes washington 39 for minnesota and 9 for touchdowns,0
short of a first down 8:40 left to play first half the vikings are leading 17 to nothing it is second and 1 or a,0
little less than one at the viking 43 yard line henderson comes left sumner s defending against him i was born it feels he s,0
inside the 45 yard line for a first down and kellerman and howell the secondary had to stop him one more time you see mr,0
osmond apparently stopped for no gain sometimes even a loss just bounces and keeps rolling normally on that down during the season you would have,0
seen camp gamble s second and one on the proposition that is throw the long ball in a proposition if he doesnt complete he comes,0
back and gets the 1yard on third down but on a field like this you cant be sure plunging one yard any time because somebody,0
might slip on the tick off and youre just dead right there first down at the cleveland 42 for minnesota oscar reed to the 37,0
ran into houston 82 in kellerman 24 8:20 left to play now in the first half reed picks up five yards on first down it,0
s second down five well have videotape highlights for you at halftime statistics and entertainment the tight end is on the right side beasley second,0
down five read inside the 35 but short of a first down walter johnson the first to make contact third and short yardage at the,0
34 yard line about two yards away from a first down now the situation is a little different he is far enough in enemy territory,0
that if he wishes he can gamble on this down and kept so often likes to fake that dive play and hit the long long,0
pass at temperd at least now the vikings have two tight ends in as kent frank cramer comes in and wide receiver john henderson goes,0
out third and to osborne he has a first down at the 30 yard line kellerman made the tackle and kent kramer immediately leaves and,0
wide receiver john henderson comes back number 41 and so far the running star of the game dave osborne first and ten oscar read and,0
varied a little there in the middle this time mainly responsible walter johnson ron snide oh helped out gain a yard and a half second,0
down at about eight somewhere along the way well give you a shot of cap between plays he walks deliberately towards the sideline away from,0
the huddle there s a reason for this probably he has only ten suggestions coming up on the way back to the huddle and so,0
his coach but grant has said to get away from all this just walk away to you make up your mind and then step in,0
the huddle second and eight anderson it s very hard by barnes close to a first down it is a first down there goes cap,0
for his lonely sojourn over there he takes a look at everything walks away does little thinking then comes back in the huddle when he,0
s made up his mind what play he wants to you the first down comes at the cleveland 20yard line and there s bud grant,0
talking with his men upstairs on the phones washington goes to the right and henderson comes out to the left side osborne touchdown take a,0
look at oz for now this young man simply will not be denied you will see he s hit pretty well here he tried to,0
come in high on him and that you just cant do it that way slipped off he kept going cut back behind the one blocker,0
he had ahead of them into the end zone as you see osborn has carried eight times for 60 yards bret cox puts another point,0
on the board and now the vikings lead 24 to nothing and well be back with minnesotas,0

metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota it s a national football league championship game the minnesota vikings play host to the cleveland browns good morning and,0
good afternoon im ray scott pat summerall is here bruce roberts is here and by my side is paul chrisman paul how do you figure,0
today s game ray it s a little bit tough to figure but we can say there s last week the rams had some degree,0
of success in running in the first half at least against the great front 4 of minnesota but today they are facing leroy kelley probably,0
one of the finest runners in the nfl and both scott who had a great game just last week there is no question that rita,0
cleveland s running game consists of a trap and a sweep it s a very simple offense but theyve made it very effective through the,0
years paul do you eliminate entirely any psychological edge that might belong to the vikings as a result of their onesided victory over the browns,0
here a few weeks ago i do eliminate it ray because what it looks good to the vikings might make the browns just that much,0
matter this time okay paul will join pat summerall and cbs control in just a moment as the nfl today continues in 1965 we developed,0
an experimental blade called eb7 stainless steel with a plastic coating today weve developed a better blade not a be 8 9 or 10 its,0
eb 11 with a new platinum alloy edge that s harder than stainless and more durable than chrome to shave you not just cleaner but,0
smoother eb 11 we call it gillette platinum plus the blade youve always wanted and more over the years we had herds have learned what,0
it is to travel to be lost to be without a place to stay or know where to get a decent meal so as a,0
company weve trained our people to help and given them the means with which to help weve taught them that running you afford is just,0
where they begin this of course is the 50th year of professional football and as you look back at the history of this great game,0
it seems that each period each ten years was dominated by one or two teams if you look back at the 30s it was the,0
bears the giants and the redskins after the war the battles between the cardinals and the eagles in the early 50s it was a cleveland,0
browns and a detroit lions later in the 50s of course those memorable years between the baltimore colts and the new york giants then as,0
you come to the 60s with the possible interruption here theyre from the cleveland browns the 60s belong to the green bay packers join us,0
now as we go back and look at just a few of the highlights of those first 50 years in 1920 george halas found at,0
the nfl and his coach of the chicago bears he gave the game its first great superstar and red grange ran wire in 1933 george,0
preston marshall won his fight for an nfl championship game matching the winners of the western conference and the top team in the east fittingly,0
hollis s bears were the western champs their foes the new york giants and on a cold day in wrigley field they defeated the giants,0
23 to 21 the same two teams met in the 1934 game unable to find footing or success on the slippery field the giants trail,0
13 three late in the game but the team s trainer spent the third quarter in search of tennis shoes he found them and with,0
solid footing beneath them the giants scored 27 points in the final quarter to win 32:13 in 1937 the rookie named bog quarterback the washington,0
redskins to an nfl title as the bears fell beneath swinging sammy s arm 28 to 21 but the decade still belong to the bears,0
and the giants who had struggled for seven years both teams stalking a dynasty by 1940 neither team had a clear edge but the bears,0
had the stubborn mine of george halas on their side with sid luckman his quarterback alice drew diagrams and his bear has followed them to,0
perfection as they routed the redskins 73 to nothing in the 1940 title game it still stands as the most onesided game in championship history,0
chicago and the t were to go on to dominate most of the decade but in 1948 and 1949 the philadelphia eagles took up the,0
balance by winning backtoback championships for the first time in nfl history with steve van buren leading the charge philadelphia seemed well prepared for the,0
50s but the cleveland browns and their great quarterback otto graham came onto the scene in 1950 a superb passer in respected leader graham led,0
his team to a divisional championship in each of his 10 years as quarterback by 1946 his team had played in six nfl championship games,0
and won three of them ran and the browns were a sensation in the fifties they might never have lost had it not been for,0
the detroit lions and bobby leigh lane had a way with men it was a commanding leader gaining both the respect didnt fear of all,0
those who played for it he passed a curious jinx over the browns as the lions beat cleveland in the 50 to 53 and 57,0
title game the most famous game of the decade maxed johnny unitas in the colts against feared for a mankiller sam huff and the giants,0
this 1958 championship has been called the greatest game ever play with a score tied at the end of regulation play a suddendeath overtime was,0
begun the first in championship history alan ameche went in for the touchdown and the baltimore fans went wild america had a new sports idol,0
and the game of football was ready to blast into the television age of the sixties it was time for vince lombardi to charm the,0
football world and beat everybody inside the packers completely dominated the decade playing in six nfl championship games and winning fiber lombardi was the king,0
and his kingdom was never on better display than in 1967 when a pack played dance incredible coal incredible fans and a blocked by jerry,0
kramer the pack wind for the third year in a row lombardi becomes a legend today the browns and the vikings battle for power the,0
winner may start a new dynasty but the packer legend will be high to overcome and now well take a look at some more recent,0
history and well be back with the last game the browns and the vikings played in just a moment as the nfl today continues remember,0

corn you get more it was midseason the last time these two teams met like now cleveland had just come off a big win over,0
dallas that time the score was 42 to 10 last week the browns beat dallas 38 to 14 when they came to metropolitan stadium before,0
cleveland lost 51 2 3 let s take a look jill kept warmed up and wondered bill nelson seems smooth and weathered his bomb was,0
on but the vikings were perfect led by the purple front for the vikings defense put nelson through a meat grinder and out came a,0
tender lag and when the front 4letter it was only so the secondary could make the cleveland receivers forget about catching the ball as good,0
as the defense was joe captain the offense were better captain wide receiver gene washington number 84 put on a stunning exhibition when it was,0
over washington had caught seven passes for 119 yards and three touchdowns all in the first half on one play cap simply pointed out to,0
washington where he was going to throw the ball incredibly he was not covered and the vikings jumped to a 27 threeleaf but it wasnt,0
all passers as the viking runners tore through the brown defense cleveland runners could gain only 42 yards rushing all afternoon and a total of,0
only eight first down the vikings scored the first nine times they hand the ball and punted only once but the best show was still,0
cap in washington and what is becoming his expected style capped rolled out and then looked big other way getting ready to jump another touchdown,0
pass to washington when it all ended the vikings were on the top side of a fifty one to three score the biggest rout of,0
the year and the worst in browns history it was a day the browns will certainly have in the back of their minds when they,0
take the field today well see how the browns and vikings got into today s championship game in just a moment as the nfl today,0

checking account it s not a fullservice bank whatever you are banking needs look for this symbol of service a week ago paul crispin and,0
maury scott were here in minnesota watching the rams play the minnesota vikings the next day jack buck and i were in dallas where dallas,0
was favored over the cleveland browns let s take a look at some of the highlights of that game first time cleveland had the ball,0
they were forced to punt don cockroft got out of a high short punt bob hayes had signaled for fair catch the linemen down underneath,0
never saw the ball the ball bounced off a field right cleveland recovered and you could almost see dallas wilt at that point bill nelson,0
went right to work to warfield who had a great day this in the early minutes of the first quarter nelson again this time dumped,0
right over the middle to morin and this sets up the first cleveland touchdown and here is the touchdown the one that gave cleveland a,0
seven nothing lead a block by kelly in front and both scott gets in he s their new fullback he replaced ron johnson nelson again,0
in action he fakes the end sweep to kelly a maneuver that he used throughout the day he finds more and again it seems it,0
morin always has big days against dallas nelson spectacular throughout the day this time to warfield at the 1 cleveland was penalized 5 yards because,0
of back feeling motion after this so now theyre back at the 6 they put this play in the day before the game nelson to,0
his tight end morin 89 kleavon got the vault in the closing seconds of the first half after dallas had to give it up nelson,0
fired strike again this time to warfield in the middle flavin throws to a wide variety of receivers that youll see morin clears the area,0
nelson throws down the middle to both scott scott fumbles and it s recovered by their offensive sin center fred hoagland they got a field,0
goal just after that from don cockroft and at halftime it was 17 nothing the cleveland browns over dallas and dallas fans hoped hoped that,0
something could take place at halftime that might get their team back on the right track such was not to be the case in the,0
early moments of the third quarter craig morton who had a tough day for dallas back to pass must be excellent coverage fine rush by,0
cleveland and houston intercepts and romo rambles down the sidelines some 33 yards before they can get him down nelson went right back to work,0
he lost none of his sharpness at halftime screen pass to kelly behind excellent blocking down in front kelly almost got in now from the,0
end zone the second touchdown of the day by cleveland fullback both scott that s bob lilley coming across in front of him and that,0
should give you some indication of the strength that scott possesses nelson on a draught oh leroy kelley a fine block in front by gary,0
collins number 86 as you can see on cornell green that s just at the end of the third quarter beginning the fourth quarter kelly,0
gets his touchdown that made it cleveland 31 dallas 7 at that point this is the place we told you that theyd like to work,0
on cleveland while similar intercepts 88 yards later cleveland has its 37th and 38 point as dynatac drops extra point was good and that s,0
the way it was at the cotton bowl in dallas pretty much a onesided affair 38 to 14 the final score the day before it,0
was different here wasnt it paul pat you had a lot of spectacular plays a lot of running up and down the field a lot,0
of long passes all that spectacular type of football it was a kind of a grind amount football game here in the stadium at minnesota,0
and here are the highlights here this is joke calf throwing to washington to the outside who falls and slips out of bounds there the,0
field incidentally was not frozen but the field around was right at the edge of the sideline here s cap again and watched this washington,0
once again on a crossover and now cap throwing off the wrong foot again as he so often does watch him now hits washington who,0
keeps both feet inbound and that s the one that took him down to their first touchdown this is osburgh he this is called second,0
effort watch him now hell roll hell claw his way into that end zone he does that s a touchdown right there we are at,0
the half now and despite the fact that we have shown you viking highlights the vikings went into the dressing room behind 17 to 7,0
so we better pick up the second half highlights here and this is joe kapp showing the washington watch hell make the catch get up,0
to run and party hits him and is penalized for doing so quite a bit of discussion on this play i watched cap back to,0
throw and this is why he is so very valuable he cannot find a receiver watch what he does down to the oneyard line and,0
puts them in great scoring position here s osman again watch him hit hard into this end zone now being led by bill brown in,0
he goes here s osman again i watch him roll here he stopped they need a first down i need a couple of yards he,0
stopped apparently cold he rolls on picks up about four yards and a very vital first down here s cap again now taking him into,0
scoring position once again cant find a receiver watch what he does fine runner he s directing traffic here now telling the blockers out ahead,0
of them to help out down to the 4 yard line watch the blocking you can barely see it in the left corner of your,0
screen cap on a roll out and he gets great blocking ahead of him nobody touches him till he just gets to the goal and,0
it s too late there this is roman gabriel now karl eller knocking him into the end zone for safety were going to show you,0
that in slow motion mr eller 81 this great defensive man watch him go by bob brown a fine offensive blocker and pickoff gabriel right,0
here and he s heading back yards knock him into the end zone and those were the last two points that the minnesota vikings scored,0
and pat that s the way it went from here true entirely different type of games paul and ill take a stab at evaluating these,0
two teams in just a moment as the nfl today continues when you travel for a living you travel when it s good for your,0
business not when it s good for you while renting fords over the years we at hertz have come to understand the plight of the,0
traveling businessman and instead of just offering you sympathy weve actually devised a number of way to help you see it hurts you dont just,0
rent a car you rent a company search no more the quest for the ultimate blade is over gillette introduces platinum plus the played with,0
an edge of gillette astonishing new platinum alloy platinum plus harder than stainless more durable than chrome to shave you not just cleaner but with,0
more comfort than any blade in history gillette platinum plus per blade youve always wanted paul and i have worked at our own rating system,0
on these two teams the cleveland offense against the viking offense the viking defense against the brown defense we used a scale of ten ten,0
would be the maximum obviously both of these teams would have to rank very high since they are in the championship game and because paul,0
has been with the vikings a lot more than i have i think this is a fifth game he s covered of theirs ive asked,0
him to take the viking defense ill take the brown defense so paul the defense first pet i think we should mention here that sure,0
rahman does a very workmanlike job as a cornerback here kesakhian kraus our fine safety man crossed the free safety man and he does a,0
good job of playing the ball all the time which he should do mac bae a note from the scouting book is this that he,0
likes to play back a little bit he will give you a little of the short stuff but he doesnt like to let you throw,0
the long run on him and he has intercepted a lot of passes this year because people have tried to get behind him we rank,0
these people about eight and a half winston and hildenburg do an excellent job of playing the screens as well as the runs they are,0
fine outside linebackers warwick weve mentioned so often the middle linebacker only has time to play the passers eyes in certain cases and he does,0
this very well when we get to the front four this is where i think the vikings will hang their head and that is that,0
great pass rush mr eller we referred to as the chairman of the board and he certainly is these other people are just about as,0
good we cannot give them a ten ranking because the rams did a pretty good job of running on these two men the first half,0
at least but not so well the second half but there s our total for the viking defense and let s have a little bit,0
on the brown defense pat this is the brown defensive unit that dallas coach tom landry described last week as being the one that would,0
bend but would not break last week against dallas they didnt even bend the front for not very spectacular certainly not as much publicized as,0
the front for for minnesota the outstanding members i think youd have to say would be the writein jack gregory and the left defensive tackle,0
walter johnson the other two snide oh and kenickie as they say give you a good game every week the linebackers dale lindsay the middle,0
man started on the outside at the beginning of the year then he moved him to the middle linebacker position and that seemed to be,0
the move that sort of solidified the brown defense they are very active all three of the linebackers get back very deep and help out,0
the the men in the secondary on task coverage of the three houston is the best blitzer the secondary they say every secondary every defensive,0
unit needs a killer one headhunter so called of that group it would be irresponsible one that sticks you the leading pass interceptor is mike,0
howell who s the free safety he intercepted six passes on the year the place that everybody tries to work is on the rookie the,0
lone rookie in the secondary that would be walt sumner the right cornerback without success in recent weeks he picked one off against dallas last,0
week returned at 88 yards we give him an eighth in all three categories for a total of 24 so the vikings there have a,0
three point advantage as far as were concerned now let s go back to the viking offense and your appraisal paul and pat we will,0
start with the two outside man jerry had a big week last week against the deacon a big game i should say did a fine,0
job alderman s of fine working like tackle im speaking mainly of pass protection now these two guards are pretty good pulling guards on the,0
running plays tingle hoff has made allpro and is particularly adept at picking up the strays on the blitzing maneuver by the linebackers when you,0
get over to the receivers here washington and henderson have two of the same type theyre both tall men they do not run like bob,0
hayes but they are pretty fast they get down the field well and they have great jumping ability believe it or not this is a,0
real asset in their favor many coaches have said that beasley is really the bread and butter guy of this three i had one coach,0
tell me we contain these two men pretty well but beasley is the guy that beat us we get over to the running backs they,0
are the same as the entire viking team they are not spectacular they just get the job done the same can be said of joe,0
kapp who is not a classic passer is not anything all he does is win and that s the way this ballclub has gone all,0
year we had up to 25 and a half for the viking offense pad the brown offense spectacular i think is an adjective you could,0
use to describe them the offensive line chef rant dmarie hoagland hickerson and clark is as fine a unit as youll find anywhere the two,0
tackles clark and shaffer f both are very quick they can get out in front of leroy kelly on the quick pitches and the two,0
guards the same thing can be said for them tomorrow and hickerson hickerson probably the best pulling guard in football anywhere he has been for,0
a long time he s lost none of his quickness none of his speed the receivers again i think as a unit they are probably,0
as fine as anybody in professional football warfield the most dangerous i think collins coming off of his one of his finest years he caught,0
54 passes more in the tight end is classic in size six four and 250 and he has the speed and strength to take a,0
ball out of a crowd and get away from the tacklers the running backs leroy kelly i think enough has already been said about him,0
he is probably the one of the finest in the business but you ask any of the members of of the brown team whether it,0
be offense defense special teams coaches whatever theyll tell you the man that s pulled the whole club together as bill nelson and his performance,0
against dallas last week i guess could be subscribed as spectacular twenty seven and a half points then we give the running backs in nelson,0
9 the receivers nine and a half the offensive line nine so we get 27 and a half we beat you by two there if,0
you total this up youll see that the vikings only have a onepoint advantage as far as were concerned over the cleveland browns yet in,0
regular season paul minnesota 151 to three how do you expect it s just the way this ballclub has been all year pat as we,0
have münster theyre not spectacular they do the job one plus i think we should mention for the browns offense leroy kelly a greatest one,0
of the great runners of the league also a very clutch pass receiver he has fine hands and does a great job and has pulled,0
him out of the hole many times it looks like the brown offense is going to go against the viking defense in particularly these people,0
youve heard so much about that front for gore says you think about it there s so many intangible things the weather and then of,0
course you cant forget about the leading scorer in the league fred cox who scored 121 points the most ever for a kicker that has,0
to be a definite plus for minnesota well be back at metropolitan stadium in just a moment as the nfl today continues there s no,0

pleasantly cold the temperature is nine degrees above the winds out of the northwest at 10 miles an hour and the sun is shining brightly,0
as far as the condition of the field is concerned dick eriksen and his ground crew here have done a truly remarkable job immediately after,0
last week s viking ran game they covered the complete surface including the end zones with a 2inch thick fiberglass blanket that in turn was,0
covered by a tarp and then blowers were brought in to see that the ground did not freeze and as of right this as of,0
this moment you can see the flamethrowers in the background theyre working at it so we have fairly ideal conditions but by halftime the ground,0
might freeze and some changes will have to be made that s the situation as of this moment well be ready for the start of,0

for 1970 well paul as far as the weather is concerned we have sunshine in case the sunshine should disappear here at bloomington minnesota the,0
lights are turned on the field i think it s safe to say to echo what bruce robert said is that it is in as,0
good a condition as it is possible to be at this time of year in this part of the country would you agree i agree,0
ray i dont think were gonna see any snow today i think it s going to remain very cold because of the lack of cloud,0
cover and there is a possibility the field might freeze about the half and if it does it might change the russia that great front,0
for of minnesota the officials for our game today the referee is tom bell the umpire joe connell the head linesman george murphy jack fetty,0
is the line judge ralph vandenberg the back judge fritz graph the field judge there are alternates here today as well bernie almond and bruceton,0
laysan so well be ready for the start of today s game in just a moment when you seek the ones who have that word,0
look to them to guide you there hawaiian s have been reading united airlines passengers to their little corner of the world for 23 years,0
and since then tonight it has flown more people to the islands for more cities than any other airline and that s why we call,0
it our little corner of the world what is that friendly star to prove that maverick is the simple machine we asked five stewardesses to,0
put it back together they proved it maverick the simple machine still just 1995 when everything else is going up the cleveland browns defensive unit,0
has been introduced and as you will judge by the roar of this capacity crowd or near so the minnesota vikings offensive unit is being,0
introduced nick tingle hoff of nebraska jim malone of southern california milt sunday of minnesota brady alderman from detroit ronnie ra of southern california have,0
all been introduced michigan state s jean washington the split end tight end john beasley washington from michigan state beasley of california dave osborne number,0
41 you saw a moment ago from north dakota bill brown the fullback from illinois john henderson michigan and the quarterback there s henderson number,0
80 and the quarterback joke cap i would say the calling out of his name he both the greatest bit of applause we have heard,0
so far today head coach blanton collier of the browns was introduced head coach but granted the minnesota vikings the cleveland browns have won four,0
national football league championships they have appeared in ten nfl championship games in fact they have appeared in three of the last five their last,0
championship came in 1964 they were on the losing end in championship games in 1965 and in 1968 joe kapp i think that over these,0
last few weeks paul chrisman our sports following public of this country has learned to know a lot about this young man he does everything,0
the wrong way you know as we said all he does is win and that s im sure that s getting a little tiresome to,0
hear but it s just the way he plays ball he apparently has a fine delivery here but you see him in the ball game,0
showing with his right foot forward at his right foot sideways and every other way but he gets the ball of the receivers which is,0
what counts and he gets it there on time referee tom bell indicating the minnesota vikings have won the toss and have elected to receive,0
the temperature we will repeat is nine above zero the wind is out of the northwest at 12 miles per hour the playing field and,0
again and again we will say at the playing field as of right now is in good condition a comparison with last week when the,0
vikings played the los angeles rams here snow actually had crept on to just the edges of the playing field necessitating sideline markers of a,0
red like dust well now the same red dust is being used today but the snow is well away from either sideline so i dont,0
think paul will have any problem determining whether a player is in or out of bounds we know i dont think we will either ray,0
there s that red line shows up better than anything and also we remind you again there are flags intermittently about every 10 yards along,0
the field and dont be surprised if you see one and a ball player rolls out of bounds you might think automatically it is the,0
goal line it is not there s a flag right there and theyre all along the sidelines on both sides just in case of any,0
tough weather they may need these things the flagraising is being taken care of by a combined color guard from the us army and marine,0
corps the biking band directed by mr ralph mendenhall will play the anthem the singing here will be led by mr charles wood so our,0
players are at attention and we all join in the singing of our national anthem well thanks right oh so the minnesota vikings make their,0
first appearance ever in a national football league championship game with the exception of nine firstyear men all of these cleveland browns were on the,0
squad last year that lost in the championship game to the baltimore colts don khakhra tees it up for cleveland deep number 40 charlie west,0
number 26 clint jones so the talking and the writing are over it s down to the play were glad youre with us the browns,0
and the national football league championship at bloomington minnesota charlie west at the 8th to the 30 first man to medium fill andrews as our,0

82 the left washington 84 to the right from the viking 30% end cap intended for henderson broken down by walt sumner you had a,0
chance to see the minnesota vikings offensive unit most of them at least so right now as the vikings are second in ten from their,0
30 let s set up the cleveland defense for you up front for cleveland gregory 81 kenickie 69 johnson 71 and snide oh 88 the,0
three linebackers in the middle lyndsey 51 flanked by garlington 50 and houston 82 second and 10 minnesota bill brown four yards 34 yard line,0
lindsey stockton and now the brown deep men at the right corner you saw him break down the first pass thrown walt s under 29,0
at the left corner is 12year veteran number 40 eric barnes mike howell 34 and ernie kellerman 24 round out the cleveland secondary for minnesota,0
third down six from the viking 34 to the right henderson to the left washington brown first down linebacker jim houston made the tackle but,0
the vikings have a first down take a little look at it now this is a draw type play see him wait for the ball,0
to be brought back to it and that gives a trap man time to get out there and make his block and here s the,0
cut as he gets to the line of scrimmage this moves slightly to the outside good gainer result gain of nine first and 10 vikings,0
minnesota 43 to the wide side the right has henderson for washington it was in bounds picture of this all alone now watch him washington,0
you will see his feet her in even though his body may not as he leans oh he s still he s in all the,0
way it looked like his body was slightly out of bounds but he did have both feet in he had as he caught the ball,0
in vines all the way as it turned out so cap to washington first down cleveland 24 yard line gained 33 yards washington left henderson,0
right brown he s inside the 20 mike howell of the secondary 34 walter johnson number 71 mainly responsible for stopping that play but the,0
ball 18 a 19 yard line of cleveland it is second down and four and a half our game is just underway as we look,0
along the sidelines at the minnesota vikings bench washington lavell anderson right he s inside you know that s the way osman has run the,0
entire season he s always got that second after watch him now he looks like he s stopped there s a little crossbuck move there,0
he s hit bang rolls keeps going watch how much more yardage he picks up after he was apparently stopped there s some real effort,0
sumner prevented a touchdown perhaps he was the last man it s first and goal at the cleveland seven after three and a half minutes,0
henderson incomplete defending hereit s barnes we got our first look at the elements the elements in this case in zone although they claim it,0
is not frozen this is apparently a little tougher than the playing field henderson try to do a little maneuver there started in the end,0
and tried to cut quickly and go to the outside and he slipped a little bit he didnt get any ground on the defensive man,0
at all they were both kind of skating around there as they ran through the end zone by the way there was some doubt about,0
footwear but they are wearing regular football shoes second and goal at the cleveland seven for the vikings the ground chap i believe wanted to,0
give the ball to bill brown watch it s a busted play this is the best bus in the world six points he ran into,0
each other he s supposed to go off tackle and the defense moved to take brown instead camp right up the middle and you see,0
what happened six points fred cox with krause holding will try for the seventh point a penalty marker is down offside cleveland it s declined,0
the extra point stands at seven nothing minnesota will be back with the vikings kickoff in just a woman the pizza see you later take,0
care that leg huh yeah yeah live it up you guys well i guess it s just you and me buddy yeah me my winston,0
s me in my winston s we got a real good thing real good taste when it comes to keeping a guy good company there,0
s almost nothing like a winston one taste and itll be you and your winston yeah winston king or super king you got a real,0
good thing so the vikings go 66 yards and score on a play that was not intended to be a seven yard run by kat,0
cox kicks off deep our morrison and slack morrison just got his hands on it in the end zone for a touchback but a viking,0
was there a split second after morrison covered that ball touch back ground start from the brown 2011 oh three left first quarter in the,0
vikings lead by seven to nothing in their first nfl championship game ever starting for cleveland in the backfield bill nelson is the quarterback number,0
16 running backs are kelly 44 and scott 35 carl eller number 81 here against monte clark the right tackle eller bypasses is hit by,0
two people still split some makes the tackle but for a four yard gain second down six cleveland warfield 42 left collins 86 to the,0
right nelson both scott first now 38 yard line carl eller made the tackle nelson during the regular season completed 54% of his passes he,0
threw 23 touchdown passes id say in the latter part of the season particularly the last month we have seen more and more of that,0
last type of play it s like a screen to lineman get out there ahead of but it s just a quick swing pass to,0
either side first and 10 cleveland at the brown 38 intendant laura he collided with linebacker wally hell confirm on e warwick was back there,0
it was warwick that ran into morin as the past reached moren second down 10 cleveland 944 left first quarter vikings lead 7 nothing joe,0

hits for the sidelines as for cleveland it is fourth and five 902 left to play first quarter vikings lead 7 nothing charlie west number,0
40 bob grim number 27 are the deep man and for what it s worth are in a terrific sun feel in this first quarter,0
the sun is directly behind the kicker batra punting from inside the 30 fair catch west 24 yard line of minnesota with the score the,0
vikings seven in the browns nothing let s pause for a moment mechanics have a ticklish problem with a mattone it does part of their,0
job so as mechanics they shouldnt like it but as customers they do who knows better what it does for your engine standard oil healers,0
welcome mechanics in strict confidence we wont tell if you dont the one you like best just got better the goodyear custom wide tread poly,0
"glass tires 38,000 miles on the set of tires is quite a few miles i dont id say you could go across the united states",0
"two or three times easy and with 38,000 miles on them i wouldnt be afraid to go across two or three more times it s",0
a real grip and tire on wet pavement if it doesnt say goodyear it cant be poly glass who went 66 yards for a touchdown,0
after the opening kickoff and lead seven nothing our first and ten at their own 24 cat still has it for washington 35 yard line,0
of cleveland with walt sumner defending it is incomplete im trying to recall paul that kept mainly throw out of that little rollout last week,0
against the rams yes he did quite often ray and in fact in our highlights from last week we showed him whirling out there and,0
throwing that first pass to washington down to the 2 yard line which took him in for their first touchdown on this last play washington,0
faked a little sideline it just took a jog step to the outside and kept right on going camp through down the middle of the,0
field i dont know whether it s against the wind or what but washington had to circle it and couldnt reach it second down 10,0
minnesota from the viking 24 brown practically no game ron schneider number 88 mainly responsible for fighting up the play the cleveland defensive unit gregory,0
kenickie johnson snide oh the front for there was a gain of a yard for minnesota it is third and nine at the viking 25,0
824 left to play first quarter minnesota leads 7 nothing and captain s henderson to the lab and washington to the right washington his defender,0
fell down let s now watch him now kept going back i dont believe youll be able to see washington is maneuver but the defender,0
did slip as he turned to cut over the middle see how all alone he is here no one within 10 15 yards of it,0
sexual seized penetrating here he really isnt airing out because he has all the room here it s barns fell down around midfield and so,0
now the vikings lead 13 to nothing and fred cox with paul krause holding will try to make it 14 753 left to play first,0
quarter it is in minnesota well be back with the vikings kickoff in just a woman when you spend your life working hard at something,0
you like you learn to take every little bit of goodness that comes along youve earned it and you know you really dont get any,0
second chances because you only go around once in life so you got a grab for all that gusto you can even in the beer,0
you think i settle for less when youre out of schlitz youre out of beer joe kapp has completed two of five passes jean washington,0
has certainly lived up to his reputation as one of the great deep receivers the vikings have a two touchdown that kick is out of,0
bounds and therell be a five yard penalty against the vikings the head coach of the cleveland browns is referred to over and over again,0
in descriptive phrases like mildmannered the word gentlemanly is used and certainly id have to say paul he s one of the truly softspoken head,0
coaches ive ever known but also one of the real greats in this coaching profession incidentally among other people he taught a young man named,0
bud grant as he started him off and there is bud grant the head coach of the minnesota vikings so now the vikings will kick,0
from their 35 yard line deep again our morrison 26 and scott 35 bo s scott to the 25yard line bob grim number 27 bulldogging,0
to the ground first and 10 cleveland at the brown 25 we have just about reached the midway point of the first quarter those kickoffs,0
that you saw one out of bonds and the other that nearly went out of bounds on the opening kickoff were not accidents they are,0
kicking the kickers kicking to the open space in the field attempting to get the ball over there on a line drive nelson has warfield,0
to the left and gary collins to the right kelly and spot for the running backs oh bat it down allen page number 88 it,0
will be second and 10 for the third year in a row cbs will televise a national hockey game of the week that starts on,0
sunday january 11 super bowl day on that day the nhl series will kick off with the defending champion montreal canadiens taking on the new,0
york rangers at 12:30 eastern time super sunday next sunday on the cbs second down 10 cleveland leroy telly the linebacker wally hell convert the,0
left fine back the right linebacker of the minnesota vikings and that was all hillenburg there because he played off a blocker had a good,0
lead on him he still played him off well made the tackle you must also know if youre watching that this really puts the job,0
on the offensive line of cleveland now because being behind 14 points in the first quarter obviously nelson will have to go to the air,0
more often than he would like so it would change his game plan and also the defense vikings can afford to gamble a little more,0
now it is third and 10 broken down at the 39 yard line by winston and kazuki and except for their collision on a pass,0
intended for colonies it is now 4th and 10 as cockroft is cutting from inside the 15 to grim and west west at the 37,0
and that s all tonight on the network of the stars cbs a very special starstudded night for the entire family ed sullivan starts off,0
the evening with a new singing sensation oliver roy rogers and dale evans will be there and the newest dolly on broadway phyllis diller glen,0
campbell s goodtime hour will follow with music and dancing an allstar show then the mission impossible team will join forces and will bring you,0
a special showing adventure of a bizarre mystery that might be the show of the year tonight on cbs first down vikings viking 37 bill,0
brown whistle death at the 42 and a half or three yard line as snide oh and houston made the stop the vikings are leading,0
by 14 to nothing having scored the first two times they had the ball we have word now from the sidelines that the playing surface,0
is still generally good there are a few spots that are frozen and as a result of course are slippery brown picked up five yards,0
second down five at the viking 42 hell brown and he loses ron snide oh the defensive end number 88 made that find offensive play,0
and for the vikings itll be third and now a little more than five you know just thinking giving you the thinking of the quarterback,0
under normal circumstance the quarterback in this situation would have a little bit of a tendency to be just a little cozy on this down,0
because everybody s expecting a pass i dont think you need worry about joe camp doesnt matter what the score is he s all out,0
all the way henderson is to the wide side the left dave osborne penalty marker down a loss back to the 38 yard line and,0
ernie kellerman of the secondary number 24 with help mainly the man who stopped the play but there was a penalty marker as the play,0
was developing for 20 left to play first quarter the vikings lead 14 nothing a clipping penalty the browns decline they want the ball it,0
will be fourth down fourth down and about 10 the punter for minnesota is bob lee and we have word from the sidelines that that,0
clipping was on henderson bobbly punts rhys morrison 35 yard line he and leroy kelly were the deep man and he feel that that one,0
like an outfielder paul get indeed and also i noticed his white shoes ray i think those are tennis shoes but i cant be sure,0
yet so the browns down by 14 nothing four minutes nine seconds left to play in the first quarter cleveland first and ten at the,0
cleveland 34 and a half wide right collins left warfield tight end morin on the right side troy kelly to the 37 he ran into,0
alan page let s set the viking defense for you now youve had a chance to watch their offense most of the first quarter the,0
viking defense the front for marshall 70 page 88 larson 77 and eller 81 the three minnesota linebackers are hilgendorf off t8 warwick in the,0
middle 59 at his left roy winston number 64 cleveland second down 8 at the cleveland 37 kelly humble like watch hell convert number 58,0
now backing up his he s gone back to protect now he comes in to make the tackle here s the fumble he s hit,0
you see when he s hit the second time on the elbow from the rear that s when the ball popped out paul krause we,0
believe is responsible for the recovery first and 10 minnesota at the cleveland 43 osbourne about the 39yard line pinned down by the to cleveland,0
tackles kenickie and johnson gain of three between two and three second down seven two and a half minutes left to play in the first,0
quarter caps scored on a 7 yard run and then threw a touchdown pass of 75 yards to washington as the defender e ridge barnes,0
fell down bill brown he s down to the 35 yard line where itll be a third and about to dale lindsay the middle linebacker,0
number 51 stop the minnesota running back in a way he has a decision here he has almost two and a half almost three yards,0
to go which is a long way to run so youd think he might go to the air i had the same token if he,0
wishes he has two downs to make this because he would be around the 34 yard line which if he punted would almost be back,0
there in the end zone so you know six of one half a dozen the other third buzz born first now 30 second effort husband,0
that s the way it is bouncing keep going he s done it all season number 41 dave osborne a fifth year running back from,0
north dakota he s a six footer and 205 and that short run gave the vikings of 1st and 10 at the cleveland 30 with,0
a minute and a couple of seconds left to play in the first quarter and wally hell convert did recover that fumble in addition to,0
forcing the fumble oh what a reception committee jack gregory number 81 met brown at the line of scrimmage result no gain and maybe a,0
bruise middle he was met at the pass and when youre going forward full speed and suddenly going backwards this is quite a joke he,0
got it so the brown defense sorely tested here in the first quarter which has 25 seconds remaining and the clock running the brown defense,0
digs in viking second and 10 cleveland 30 pass is complete washington first down needle threading if ive ever seen it and that s the,0
end of the first quarter with the score the minnesota vikings 14 powder reno a snowball vacation on united airlines to reno tau great skiing,0
great everything action swinging and the snowball runs from december to may come fly united airlines to the exciting world of renotahoe a world that,0
makes the most of its days and it s nights call your travel agent or united come on have a snowball were at metropolitan stadium,0
in bloomington minnesota with paul crispin pat summerall and bruce roberts this is ray scott jean washington who just left the game has grabbed three,0
passes for 120 yards including one for 75 and a td he is replaced now by bob grimm number 27 joe kapp has had a,0
huddle with the viking coaching staff it is first in ten minnesota at the cleveland 18 as we start the second quarter grim to the,0
left henderson to the right phil brown penalty marker down johnson lindsey and kenickie stopped the play 15yard infraction against the minnesota vikings the ball,0
comes back to the minnesota to the cleveland 32 yard line holding signaled by referee tommy bell and there is jean washington and now moving,0
back this far the obvious thing to do is come up with the past the defense also knows the obvious thing to do is to,0
come up with the pass so what do you come up with this is a draw type situation a screen type as well as a,0
passing situation it s first and 24 inside the 30yard line john garlington wrestles cap out of bounds there will be a gain of about,0
three or four yards and that s why cleveland is in this championship game they had that was a screen call they had it well,0
covered and there is absolutely no place to unload the ball if the screen man is covered here s beasley right here now he s,0
drifted out in the flat and you see there a couple of minute in the vicinity there s no place to throw this ball so,0
finally he has to throw a block and joe kapp runs with it but the wise thing to do is not to throw because a,0
screen pass must be thrown softly and it s easily picked off of anybody s in the area it s second and 20 at the,0
28 and washington is back in dave osborne to the 22 yard line and it will be third and 14 as jack gregory and jim,0
houston teamed up to stop dave osborne the second quarter is just underway and the vikings are leading by 14 to nothing the vikings took,0
the opening kickoff and took it all the way joe kapp scoring from 7 yards and then when a defender had the misfortune to fall,0
down gene washington caught a 75 yard touchdown pass henderson is wide right on third and 14 henderson defending was ernie kellerman ray that is,0
the exact see the shadows there that s the exact corner of the sun field i believe that ball was in range i will see,0
it well take another look now weve got him here see when he turns if the ball is in reach and look like he lost,0
it he s got a good lead on the defender here there s a question whether he could have reached it with a jump or,0
not but it looked like it was within reach but i dont think he saw the thing the league s leading scorer fred cox who,0
kicked 26 of 37 field goals attempted in the regular season well have paul krause holding at the cleveland 29 it is good the vikings,0
now lead by 17 to nothing and well be back with minnesota s kickoff in just a moment the goodyear custom wide tread poly glass,0
"tire i put about a hundred miles a day on the tires and right now i have 35,000 miles on these tires and theyve given",0
me good service they start beautifully you get good mileage safe side good you falling less there s no other tire for me on the,0
road if it doesnt say goodyear it cant be poly glass some mechanics have found an interesting answered to standard oil s new gasoline ingredient,0
amador if you cant beat them join them dangerous return man both scot 35 nearest you to his left reese morrison and i dont believe,0
morrison is wearing the traditional football shoe right now you notice there s some kind of a rippled shoe and fred cox kicks off both,0
scott at the 1125 men at the 31 yard line by mike mcgill a reserve linebacker now we have word from the sidelines that several,0
of the browns are wearing sneakers passing so far cap three of seven nelson one of five there have been no interceptions it is first,0
and ten cleveland at the cleveland 32 paul warfield is wearing a sneaker type shoe and he goes to the left number 42 it shakman,0
covers him wide right collins leeroy kelly walli hill gonzaga wrestling kelley out of bounds after a short game and the great number of the,0
browns have decided to use that rubber soled studded type of shoe im not sure about the exact terminology you know it has a number,0
of cups on the bottom of the shoe i dont know exactly how it works though but it certainly give you a little better traction,0
and cleats if the field is frozen its second and seven cleveland at the cleveland 35 bill nelson collins it let him buy too much,0
defending was mcbee the left cornerback and itll be third and seven marshall coming in there number 70 watch chef rath blocking here now does,0
a good job of keeping the alley open which is all you need to do in passing just keep him away from the passer but,0
he finally breaks through still nelson has plenty of time to throw there it is a third and seven at the cleveland 35 leroy kelly,0
first down 44 yard line leroy kelly after an early season injury came on very very strong and he wound up with 817 yards he,0
had won the rushing title the preceding two years lonnie warwick made that tackle for minnesota but the browns have a first down at the,0
cleveland 45 yard line 12 and a half minutes left to play first half the vikings lead 17 nothing to the rightest collins mcbee defends,0
against him both scott to around the 49yard line next sunday the big one in professional football itll be right here on cbs the 4th,0
annual super bowl game the national football league champion the winner of this game against the afl champion and that championship will be decided later,0
today when kansas city and oakland will meet pregame activity starts next sunday at 3 oclock eastern time from tulane stadium in new orleans cleveland,0
2nd and 5 at midfield delay both scott couple of yards 48 yard line ran into alan page alan bates number 88 plays off a,0
blocker this is another draw incidentally and this draw is the great equalizer and it keeps that pass rush down they just cant roar in,0
there at the passer each time they have to keep an eye peeled for that draw and you might notice that nelson has called two,0
out of three of the last plays as draws it is a third and three for cleveland at the minnesota 48 yard line intended for,0
collins incomplete at the forty to the best of my knowledge this is the first time that cleveland has been able to cross midfield with,0
eleven minutes and a few seconds left to play in the first half and bill nelson the cleveland quarterback who just turned the cleveland brown,0
fortunes around when he joined them nelson heads to the bench and cockroft is punting from inside the 40 40 nearest you grim 27 high,0
and out of bounds around the 20yard line heaters along the sidelines where the cleveland browns are with the score the vikings 17 and the,0
browns nothing let s pause for a moment mullins weve got to get our sales quota up this month and when i say up i,0
mean up nagging who s nagging all i said was youre getting a little punchy now come on huh really nagging if you want to,0
get away from it all you really dont have to go very far just into a quiet 1970 ford give yourself a quiet break at,0
your ford dealers ford gives you better ideas it s the going thing we are looking into the future chances are youll smoke a cigarette,0
that offers advanced filtration and good taste but wait one cigarette does all that today true filter cigarettes great taste and only 125 milligram star,0
point seven milligrams nicotine shouldnt your brand be true today there is a sport known as broom ball which is played on ice and a,0
number of the cleveland players are wearing a broom ball shoe vikings first and ten viking 20 oscar reid number 32 replaced bill brown as,0
one of the minnesota running backs reid is a 6footer secondyear from colorado state and he s done a fine job this season for the,0
vikings there is a gain of two and a half second down 810 30 left to play first half caps ends henderson to the right,0
washington to the left his tight end beasley is on the right side reid and a loss back to the 15yard line has linebackers dale,0
lindsay 51 and john garlington number 50 forced to play wide result a loss back to the 17 yard line and cap is faced with,0
a third and 13 well the folks up here in minnesota certainly have some unusual garb but most of it i would say is practical,0
ball i dont really think it s that cold yet ray but he or she is prepared for anything third and 13 minnesota washington defending,0
was barnes and complete itll be fourth down the game started today with a temperature of nine above zero and a wind of about 12,0
miles per hour the game is a complete sellout fortyseven thousand nine hundred watching the vikings in their first nfl championship game ever the browns,0
have one for nfl titles they have played in ten championship games this being the 11th kelley and jones number 26 that s figure part,0
reese morrison is the other deep man the putter is bob lee he s inside the viking five kellee 49 yard line so the browns,0
will have excellent field position tonight is a very special night on cbs ed sullivan with oliver roy rogers and dale evans plus phyllis diller,0
followed by glen campbell s goodtime hour and then the suspenseful mission impossible tonight a very special night on cbs bob lee the punter took,0
advantage of no rush there they had a punt return on so instead of two steps he took four steps before he punted that ball,0
first and ten cleveland at the viking 49 nelson intercepted at the 34 yard line and a penalty marker down wally hell converge intercepted the,0
intended receiver was both scott nelson now throwing a cross feel you saw it see him throw back to his left and here the interception,0
is pulled in now ray scott said a flag dropped i believe an official right here dropped his cap right after this to indicate where,0
the ball right fall there was no penalty first and 10 vikings viking 33 john henderson defending ear it s barnes it s close to,0
a first down watch anderson on a classic sideline pattern and note how quickly the ball comes in after he makes his cut this is,0
the secret of all this passing right there before the defensive man can recover with timing like that it s pretty difficult to defend against,0
there will be a measurement here for the down as wide receiver john henderson grabs off the joe kapp pass during the regular season henderson,0
caught 34 passes five four touchdowns collins is the leading receiver in this game today based on regular season statistics receiving 54 11 for touchdowns,0
warfield caught 10 touchdown passes washington 39 for minnesota and 9 for touchdowns short of a first down 8:40 left to play first half the,0
vikings are leading 17 to nothing it is second and 1 or a little less than one at the viking 43 yardline henderson comes left,0
sumner is defending against him osbourne midfield he s inside the 45 yard line for a first down and kellerman and howell the secondary had,0
to stop him one more time you see mr osmond apparently stopped for no gain sometimes even a loss just bounces and keeps rolling normally,0
on that down during the season you would have seen camp gamble s second and one on the proposition that has throw the long ball,0
in a proposition if he doesnt complete he comes back and gets the 1 yard on third down but on a field like this you,0
cant be sure plunging one yard any time because somebody might slip on the takeoff and youre just dead right there first down at the,0
cleveland 42 for minnesota oscar reed to the 37 ran into houston 82 and kellerman 24 8:20 left to play now in the first half,0
reid picks up five yards on first down it s second down five well have videotape highlights for you at halftime statistics and entertainment the,0
tight end is on the right side beasley second down five read inside the 35 but short of a first down walter johnson the first,0
to make contact third and short yardage at the 34 yard line about two yards away from a first down now the situation is a,0
little different he is far enough in enemy territory that if he wishes he can gamble on this down and cap so often likes to,0
fake that dive play and hit the long long pass attempted at least now the vikings have two tight ends in as kent frank cramer,0
comes in and wide receiver john henderson goes out third and to osborne he has a first down at the 30 yard line kellerman made,0
the tackle and kent cramer immediately leaves and wide receiver john henderson comes back number 41 and so far the running star of the game,0
dave osborne first and ten oscar read and very little there in the middle this time mainly responsible walter johnson ron snide oh helped out,0
gain a yard and a half second down at about eight somewhere along the way well give you a shot of cap between plays he,0
walks deliberately towards the sideline away from the huddle there s a reason for this probably he has only ten suggestions coming up on the,0
way back to the huddle and so his coach but grant has said to get away from all this just walk away to you make,0
up your mind and then step in the huddle second and eight henderson hit very hard by barnes close to a first down it is,0
a first down there goes cap for his lonely sojourn over there eight takes a look at everything walks away does little thinking then comes,0
back in the huddle when he s made up his mind what play he wants to you the first down comes at the cleveland 20yard,0
line and there is bud grant talking with his men upstairs on the followings washington goes to the right and henderson comes off to the,0
left side osborne take a look at oscar now this young man simply will not be denied you will see he s hit pretty well,0
here he tried to come in high on him and that you just cant do it that way slipped off he kept going cutback behind,0
the one blocker he had ahead of him into the end zone as you see osborne has carried eight times for 60 yards brett cox,0
puts another point on the board and now the vikings lead 24 to nothing and well be back with minnesotas,0
well be back with minnesotas,0

what baltimore does before the snap of the ball theres a shift the jets shift never seen them do that during the year matt snell,0
"over his 25 to his 26yard line and hes hit there by ordell braase, number 81, the defensive right end &gt;&gt; curt, its an interesting",0
"shift, and in a moment well give you more, but what they went into was an unbalanced line strong to the far side, the top",0

"and herman, the tackles; talamini and rasmussen, the guards; and smith, the center second down, 6 the jets on their own 26 long signal count",0

"team during the year well be throwing up these statistics during the game, and you take a look at them and heres namath for his",0
"first pass on the run to snell snell is just short of the 40 and look for the jets today, i think, to run those",0
"backs out of the backfield against the zone defense &gt;&gt; exactly right, curt and theyre looking at a strong zone to the far side of",0
"the field, and it looks like joe namath, as you called it, is gonna come up to the line of scrimmage, not go with any",0
"automatic, figure that the baltimore colts use a strong zone to the far side of the field &gt;&gt; all right, its third down, 4 to",0
go new york jets on their 40 theyve had the ball now the first three minutes of the game lets see what they do on,0
"this thirddown play they split sauer to the left and maynard to the right and boozer and snell, the set backs heres a draw to",0
"snell, and baltimore smelled that one out fred miller, 76, the defensive right tackle, stopping snell and now tim brown is going to go back",0
"he is the secondstring punt returner usually rick volk is the man back but tim brown will be deep, and jerry logan will be the",0
short man logan is a devastating blocker on these punts curley johnson tied for second in the american football league in punting he had an,0
average of 438 he can give the ball a ride low pass hes away theres a flag down on this play brown is chased back,0
"to his 18 gets to the 20, and hes upended there hes hit by rademacher, number 23, on outstanding protection but we have a flag",0
"down so lets see what this is about its an offside offside looked like smith jumped &gt;&gt; it appears, curt, if it is an offsides",0
"against baltimore, that it will still lack perhaps a foot of being a first down theyll still be faced with a fourthdown situation &gt;&gt; and",0
"theyre short about half a yard now theyre talking matt snell, number 41 curley johnson, the punter, number 33 namath usually comes in and discusses",0
"these penalties hes the offensive captain the jets are going to accept the penalty, and theyll have fourth down and a half yard to go",0
"theres rademacher, 23, who made that great tackle downfield fourth down and a half yard to go the jets on their own 44 once again",0
"tim brown as the single safety, with jerry logan up tight well, theyll give brown another shot maybe they get a better runback and the",0
"kick is to the near side brown takes it on his 18 and gets up to his 27 and number 26, jim richards, and john",0
"neidert, number 63, down to make the tackle for the jets so its first down now, as well watch baltimore go to the attack for",0
"the first time with earl morrall at quarterback hed be number 15 tom matte, left halfback, 41 jerry hill, 45, the fullback willie richardson, 87,",0
"is the flanker mackey is the tight end, 88 hes the man to really watch here today jimmy orr, the split end, number 28 now",0
they split that backfield mackeys at left tight end morralls going to the air and right away he dumps it off to the 25 to,0
the 30 is mackey mackey mackeys almost impossible to bring down by one man or two and he just throws them off like flies &gt;&gt;,0
"lets look at this in slow motion john mackey shifted from the tandem in the backfield, went to the tight end to the left side,",0
dropped back it really wasnt a screen he was just there as kind of a safety valve now watch this former syracuse great show you,0
"that he still knows how to really run with that football good run by big john &gt;&gt; all right, theyll line up in that ""i""",0
"alex hawkins is now in mackey in the backfield, then shifted out of there heres the pitch to matte matte roaring to the 50 and",0
"into jet territory and in two plays, the colts have come from their 27 to the new york jet 44 ralph baker had to make",0
"that tackle, the left linebacker of the new york jets its they may measure timeout on the officials now hills gone back in, and hawkins",0
out super bowl game being brought to you in living color exclusively on nbc a first down for baltimore they have picked up two first,0
"downs on two plays &gt;&gt; curt, let me explain what the colts are doing, and its rather apparent theyre gonna come with real power they",0
"put tom mitchell, number 84, into the game hes a rookie from bucknell, a big boy he and john mackey, number 88, are both playing",0
"to the strong side with willie richardson three big men to the strong side, and theyre running at it &gt;&gt; all right, first down for",0
"the colts on the new york jet 44 no score, just under 10 minutes to play in the first period this is jerry hill hill",0
slips away to the 40 and is downed on the 37 and the shot at him was by verlon biggs he missed him behind the,0
"line of scrimmage, and jim hudson, the strong safety, had to make the stop so now the balls on the new york jet 37 its",0
a gain of 7 and right now baltimore looks overpowering on offense they have a second down and 3 to go &gt;&gt; and right now,0
"that both units have been in the ballgame, both offensively and defensively, you can be pretty well assured that that skitterish feeling is gone now",0
"theyre settled down to some real ballplaying &gt;&gt; all right, they have a slot right jimmy orr is the nearside slotback thats matte jammed up",0
"at the 36yard line of the jets paul rochester and number 80, john elliott, the two tackles, combine elliott is very quick across that line",0
"of scrimmage, and hell get underneath a lot of plays so it is now, on the 36yard line of the jets, third down and 2",0
"to go for the colts, and no score jimmy orr is coming out, and mitchell goes back in at tight end now theyve got the",0
"doubletightend system in there, and it gives them better blocking on short yardage and theyre in tight, as youll notice third and 2 heres hill",0
"and he has that first down the exwyoming star who played sixman football in high school at torrington, wyoming, picks up the first down baltimore",0
"has the ball now on the new york jet 31, first and 10 mitchell threw the key block for him &gt;&gt; and now, curt, the",0
jets are playing the running game theyre playing it very tight carl mcadams coming in for rochester but the thing we have to watch now,0
"is jim hudson, number 22, hes been playing willie richardson awfully tight on the right side earl may decide to cross him up and go",0
"with a firstdown pass &gt;&gt; all right, the colts on the jet 31 first down mcadams now in at left tackle hill is hit and",0
"dropped back on the 34 gerry philbin, the allafl left end from buffalo, shot across that line and dumped him for a 3yard loss that",0
"makes it now second down and 13 to go each team has passed only once in this game &gt;&gt; al derogatis mentioned john mackey, possibly",0
"a pass to him theyre not blocking him at all at that line of scrimmage, the jets arent hes got a clean shot at the",0
"safetyman, jim hudson youll see him when he lines up again therell be no linebacker over him this gives him a straight shot hes a",0
"big man hes listed at 215 he looks like hes about 230 &gt;&gt; all right, mitchells in at tight end hills gone out they leave",0
matte as the lone set back morrall for his second pass throws it out it is incomplete the pass was intended for orr on the,0
far side and was covered by randy beverly now we have a third down and 13 to go for the colts there was some doubt,0
"in this game about the jet cornerbacks, some concern about them and those cornerbacks, of course, so important john sample has been inconsistent this year",0
"they wonder if beverly is gonna be big enough to stop some of these boys and only his second year of professional football third down,",0
"13 7:09 to play in the first period no score once again, that same setup matte, the lone set back morrall time again throws the",0
"same pattern and completes it to the 19yard line they blew the whistle, though that was tom mitchell, the tight end, number 84, who is",0
"an oakland raider castoff the oakland raiders released him, and he was picked up by the baltimore colts bill baird made the tackle, but its",0
"a first down now for baltimore on the new york 19 &gt;&gt; so far, curt, weve seen double wing used by both teams weve seen",0
"both teams go into an odd formation weve also seen an overshifted line &gt;&gt; all right, jimmy orr comes to the near side, with willie",0
richardson the slot jerry hills back in at fullback morrall pumps one way hes under the rush throws on the run and it is incomplete,0
"at the 6yard line, intended for willie richardson, who can make some spectacular catches second down, 10 jim hudson was over there to cover him,",0
and philbin had put the rush on morrall baltimore on the new york 19 morrall now has attempted four passes and completed two jerry hill,0
"goes back to the sideline, and tom mitchell into the game as don shula keeps alternating players in that ""i"" formation mackeys in the backfield",0
"now he hops out of it once again mattes the only back behind morrall and here on second down, hes hit, but he throws the",0
"ball and its incomplete at the 5 he was wide open tom mitchell diving for that ball sample was behind him came in there, but",0
"he had a shot to hit him, but morrall was rushed and had to throw under pressure &gt;&gt; the new york jets have not shown",0
"a great deal of red dog gerry philbins doing a fine job at that left end position larry grantham, number 60, the man that was",0
"somewhat of a question mark because of his size, did reddog from the weak side, putting big pressure on earl &gt;&gt; third down, 10 to",0
"go, for the baltimore colts theyre on the new york jet 19 no score 6:14 left to play in the first period willie richardson flanks",0
to the right jimmy orr to the left matte set behind earl morrall morrall is rushed again! squirms away and is spun down on the,0
"18 in there on him was the linebacker who blitzed, larry grantham also verlon biggs, 86 and morrall, whos not supposed to be much of",0
"a scrambler, really shook himself loose that time, or he would have been tackled 6 or 7 yards behind the line of scrimmage now its",0
"the fieldgoal team on for baltimore, as the jets stop them fourth down, 9 lou michaels, a leftfooted kicker boyd will hold michaels kicked 18",0
"out of 28 this year his kick is up and it is no good it is no good off to the right and the colts,",0
"who drove from the 27, were stopped on the jet 18 and fail to score on a field goal action will continue here at the",0
"super bowl the score the baltimore colts 0, and the new york jets 0 the colts had the ball 5 1/2 minutes in that drive",0
"without scoring now its the jets ball, first down, on their 19 namath out to snell he cant hold on to it thats twice theyve",0
"run the fullback out of the backfield &gt;&gt; curt, you mentioned that baltimore controlled that ball 5 1/2 minutes this is actually one reason why",0
"earl morrall has helped the baltimore defensive unit, because he plays more of a ballcontrol type of game than does, say, johnny unitas of course",0
"this has given the defensive unit more time to rest on the bench subsequently theyre more effective because of it &gt;&gt; and rick volk, the",0
"star safetyman, is out of action still hes been replaced by ocie austin in that important deep secondary spot second down, 10 jets on their",0
"20 no score, 5:29 to go in the first period slot right namath again plenty of time its to lammons not much down on his",0
"22 hit there immediately by miller, the tackle, who dropped back, and lenny lyles, 43, the right linebacker &gt;&gt; on that play, curt, we saw",0
"the new york jets use something theyve used very frequently this year theyve taken maynard, split him way far to the right side theyve taken",0
"george sauer, number 83, put him in the slot and then pete lammons, 87, the traditional tight end, theyve moved him from that side to",0
"the weak side &gt;&gt; bill mathis now, 31, is in at left halfback, replacing emerson boozer third and 8, the jets on their 22 namaths",0
"pass is complete for a first down to mathis on the 35yard line of the jets mathis, a very excellent pass receiver for a halfback",0
"&gt;&gt; here well see that play again namath going back you see mathis on the right of your screen leaving out of that backfield, out",0
"of his halfback position and hell go right straight downfield as he goes up finally number 53, dennis gaubatz, comes in to make the stop",0

"pass incomplete don shinnick nearly picked it off it was intended for george sauer, who had double coverage on him in fact, most of the",0

"10 we have no score getting some oxygen is matt snell with 12 1/2 to play in the first half &gt;&gt; and, curt, there was",0
an indication of what the weakside zone looks like and namath might circle his back over the middle to try to beat shinnick &gt;&gt; mathis,0
"and boozer behind namath maynard split to the right, sauer to the left heres a blitz on he dumps it off to mathis to the",0
"45 mathis into baltimore territory and out of bounds on the baltimore 48 he was driven out by bubba smith, who combines speed with size",0
"and namath read that one, as he sent his back out on a flare with the blitz on &gt;&gt; he really did you watch gaubatz",0
"calling the defensive signals and namath calling the offensive signals, and what a battle of wits is going on gaubatz, of course, trying to conceal",0
"a red dog, sometimes bringing those safetymen up, making it look like a full red dog from the safety position and namath trying to automatic,",0
"getting in those openings that are created &gt;&gt; number 53, gaubatz, calls all the defensive signals third and 4 namath fires its complete right on",0
"a line, as he hits george sauer, who went down and then curled back and from behind, lenny lyles hit him &gt;&gt; and theres that",0
"play again sauer, all sorts of moves going downfield and what makes namath so dangerous is that ability to be able to throw off balance",0
"a lot of quarterbacks are afraid to fire that ball that deep when theyre not set namath, backpedaling, can fire that ball 35, 40 yards",0
on a line thats the type of pass it takes &gt;&gt; new york now on the baltimore 34 first down the jets have driven from,0

"half, 70 and snell out to the 3 or 4, and thats all, as don shinnick, 66, and dennis gaubatz, 53, on the tackle &gt;&gt;",0
"one of the things bobby boyd might have told his teammates is, no more safety reddogging right here on this particular part of the field",0
"because, as good a job as namath does in picking those red dogs apart, they would really be weakening their defensive structure if they put",0

"the new york jets are forced to stay in a mantoman type of coverage you get the feeling, however, curt, in that type, with taking",0
"mackey deep, he might decide to take mackey deep, take the safety out of there, and try to cross behind him with either tom matte",0

"left guard to the right guard, is doing a great job on billy ray smith and number 67, dave herman, outweighed substantially, is doing a",0
"terrific job talamini at the left side, and winston hill, number 75 &gt;&gt; second down, 10 new york jets on their own 47 baltimore stunting",0
"around theyll do that before the snap of the ball heres a draw play to boozer boozer running it to the 50, and thats it",0
"and hes hit down there by number 74, billy ray smith, the veteran left tackle third down and 7 to go for the new york",0
"jets the most valuable player in todays game, selected by sport magazine, will be given the hot dodge charger rt i know that that most",0

"moving around, jumping around right over the middle to lammons, number 87 and also not only are the jets having to fathom the manipulations in",0
"that secondary, but also in that defensive line of baltimore, theyre looping, theyre crossing, theyre doing all sorts of stunts great tribute to that offensive",0
"line &gt;&gt; namath now has hit 14 out of 22 first down, jets baltimore 38 quick one maynard cant hold on to it and bobby",0
"boyd, the veteran left cornerback, number 40 its all right looked rough, but he took him down there in fact, he was just about ready",0
"to gamble, i think, kyle, of darting in front and trying to intercept that one, then changed his mind at the last second &gt;&gt; they",0
well could have been again in a number of there defensive maneuvers where actually boyd had no deep responsibility he could afford to gamble and,0
"just lay out there in the flat, looking to pick something like that off &gt;&gt; second down, 10 namath again nice protection its complete to",0
"snell first down, as namath is picking the vaunted baltimore secondary to pieces right now &gt;&gt; boy, and again you see where namath can just",0
"fire going back watch, hes going back, and hell throw that ball without hardly setting up at all see, hes still leaning backwards fires that",0
"ball just on a line &gt;&gt; first down, the new york jets, on the baltimore 24 the jets have run the most plays today theyve",0
"made the most first downs and lead in yardage five minutes to go in the third period, the jets ahead 100 namath to bill mathis",0
"and the draw play smelled out by baltimores billy ray smith, number 74, and also don shinnick, the right linebacker, number 66 so it is",0
"now on the baltimore 23 itll be second down, 9 to go for the jets &gt;&gt; and joe namath, curt, has slowed the game up",0
very much hes going with the long counts hes eating up an awful lot of time hes been hitting his back continuously he worked on,0
"mike curtis on that one pass to snell because he saw the previous drop of number 32, curtis &gt;&gt; second down, 9 the jets on",0
"the baltimore 24 snells back in, as he resets himself boozer alongside him sauer left, maynard right retreating deeper hes firing to the end zone",0
"to maynard maynard is no good he caught the ball, but he was over the end line with him was jerry logan, number 20 spectacular",0
"grab but out of bounds itll now be third and 9 namath, by the way, has tied namath is going over and seems to be",0
injured namath is injured now and what a turning point that could be in this game it seems to be his right hand and babe,0
"parillis come in for him namath has tied a super bowl record of 16 completions in a game tied lenny dawsons record &gt;&gt; curt, on",0
"that last play, the baltimore colts went to a weakside zone now, babe parilli saw it, and bill mathis came in the game with him",0
"they may decide to circle bill mathis to that side to try to beat that zone &gt;&gt; namaths passing hand is injured third down, 9,",0
"on the 24 babe parilli, 15year veteran, is now in he throws a quick one its incomplete quick slant to george sauer fourth and 9,",0
and well see the fieldgoal team come in and the big question now is joe namath he has played a spectacular game here he has,0
"run his offense beautifully hes read the blitzes today its his right hand, his passing hand and weeb ewbank following him down the sideline babe",0
"parilli will hold now on the 30yard line of baltimore jim turner will try a field goal the kick is good by jim turner turner,",0
"who kicked more field goals than any player in one season in pro history, boots his second of the game timeout action will continue here",0
at the super bowl the score the jets 13 and baltimore 0 took some warmup tosses and now is on the phone upstairs to one,0
"of his coaches, talking over the baltimore defense well see whether he comes back in tim brown and preston pearson are deep curley johnson kicking",0
"off and he lofts it high pearson hits the crossbar hits the upright its an automatic touchback baltimore first down, and unitas is going in",0
"the game now its ironical that the young fella, namath, went out with an injury and unitas gets a well, almost a standing ovation here,",0
"which he should one of the greatest players in the history of pro football &gt;&gt; curt, not only that this is really the series that",0
"the new york jets have got to come on because of the inspirational leadership of john unitas he was brilliant in the past, he still",0

"too small to play linebacker in pro football former star at ole miss now its still on the baltimore 25, and its third and 5",0
"for the baltimore colts &gt;&gt; now, curt, heres a situation where the new york jets dont want to take any chances with john the story",0
"is that john may not be able to throw deep, so beverly, who just got a big move from jimmy orr deep, could be vulnerable",0
&gt;&gt; jets have 15 first downs in this game to just 6 for baltimore third and 5 unitas incomplete intended for jimmy orr and the,0
"ball wobbled out there to him that wasnt a typical unitas pass, as kyle rote, who has played against him, will attest &gt;&gt; no, i",0
"think what john got in a little bit of trouble there as one of his own men, backing up to block for him, i think",0
"just sort of bumped him a little bit, and he had to throw over him didnt get a chance to step into his pass, as",0
"he normally likes to do injury is to namaths right thumb a sprained right thumb, but he is expected to come back in lee has",0
kicked twice 48yard average hell punt to either baird or christy the jets have stopped baltimore cold here in the third quarter a high kick,0

"smith contacted him first &gt;&gt; you see this straight type of running game, and this is about what the jets have to do to try",0
"and penetrate that baltimore line because, as al pointed out earlier, theyre not a penetrating line to where you can trap men and create big",0
"holes they hit, they slide, they have tremendous lateral movement, so your slant plays arent gonna go too well you really just have to drive",0

so that thumb is in pretty good shape &gt;&gt; 1:43 remaining in the third period the jets are leading the colts 130 third and 7,0
for new york on their own 40 hiltons now in at defensive right end and a quick slant sauer fumbles! and i believe they might,0
"have blown the whistle inside the 50, george sauer running a quick slant pattern, and it is still new yorks ball and its a new",0
"york first down, and a big one &gt;&gt; and there was a real gamble by namath he called that slant play from a quick count,",0
"so he really didnt have time to automatic to it he called that in the huddle, anticipating that baltimore would be that safetyman up there",0
faking the red dog or either coming it didnt make any difference on the quick count he can get that ball before he has time,0
"to get back &gt;&gt; all right, the jets on the 50 with a first down they now have 16 first downs to 6 for baltimore",0
deep retreat a long shot to sauer hes got it! and sauer is on the 9yard line he had the inside step on lenny lyles,0
again &gt;&gt; here he is again with that great arm just right inside sauer had put a move on lyles and there he is all,0
"alone sauer going down that little slow move, change of pace he really put it on right at that point lyles waiting for him to",0
make another move beaten by a step or two &gt;&gt; sauer has now caught 9 passes in this game for 147 yards and what a,0
"job this interior line, tackle to tackle, is doing for namath hes been touched only twice everybody thought hed get killed in this game, but",0
"he has killed baltimore so far there goes snell, roaring to the 6 of baltimore dennis gaubatz and number 20, jerry logan, who breaks horses",0
"in the offseason, making the tackle were nearing the end of the third period, and the third period has been all the jets theyve completely",0

"jets 13, and the baltimore colts 0 curt gowdy, kyle rote, al derogatis, jim simpson, pat summerall here on nbc s coverage of the super",0
bowl baltimore did not get a first down in the third period new york had the ball about 75% of the time baltimore did not,0
"cross the 50yard line &gt;&gt; curt, its really amazing when you see it, but you notice an interesting defensive change also ordell braase and don",0
"shinnick have both been out in most of that march roy hilton, number 85, is at right defensive end ron porter, number 55, is at",0
"the right cornerback linebacker, sorry &gt;&gt; the jets have a second and 6 for a touchdown on the baltimore 6 namath sets and down baltimore",0
"with a near well, a nineman front with two cornerbacks hanging on and it looked like baltimore jumped curtis may have jumped the linebacker matt",0
"snell it looked to us up here, with that motion catching your eye, that the linebacker, mike curtis, jumped on that play well see theyre",0
"coming over and talking it over with namath, the offensive captain of the jets the jets made him offensive captain this year to give him",0
"some responsibility half the distance to the goal and he took it this year he matured offside against baltimore lou michaels is now in there,",0
"and ron porter, on that goalline defense &gt;&gt; right, curt theyre going with that goalline youll recall the last time matt snell scored, it was",0
"on a slant to the left side &gt;&gt; second down and goal to go, 3 yards to go thats only the second penalty of the",0
"game heres snell trying to get outside he doesnt make it coming up to hit him, lou michaels, number 79, and rick volk, number 21",0
"&gt;&gt; the jets have an identicalappearing play where it looks like a run with billy mathis leading matt snell, only namath will keep that ball,",0
"mathis will slip on out into the end zone, out into the flat but the appearance of a run draws those linebackers and cornerbacks right",0
up we might look for him to go to it &gt;&gt; third and 3 to go for a new york jet touchdown on the baltimore,0
3 slams it to billy mathis and he cant make it did you see namath slam that ball into his belly as he started out?,0
"he wanted to be sure that on that handoff thered be no fumbles and now the fieldgoal team is coming on dennis gaubatz, the middle",0
"linebacker, made that stop on the 2 fourth and 2 for a jet touchdown, and jim turner, whos kicked two field goals in the game,",0
"now will have a short one but from an angle on the near side and when youre closer to that goal post, its a little",0
tougher theyd rather be farther back we thank you parilli will spot it on the 9 theres your kick and it is good jim turner,0
"has kicked his third field goal of the game and action will continue here at the super bowl the score the new york jets 16,",0

his fieldgoal success curley johnson kicking off and he booms it deep preston pearson fumbles it around and hes gonna have to run it out!,0
he gets to the 5 look out! and he makes a great run he turned what looked like a disaster into a 32yard kickoff return,0
"&gt;&gt; and theyre the kind of plays, curt, that always beat you because one thing that happens is the defensive unit coming downfield stops as",0
soon as they stop although im sure pearson was undecided in making that runback he did not know whether he was forced to or not,0
but its because the line stopped &gt;&gt; unitas at quarterback baltimore has not crossed the 50yard line in this half they have not made a,0
"first down unitas, a short toss to mackey and hes hit thats how you have to stop him around the ankles he has the most",0
"powerful thighs in pro football and larry grantham, who weighs 212, stopped mackey, who weighs 230 but mackeys real force is in those legs so",0
"now its on the 32yard line of baltimore second down, 5 unitas has replaced morrall here late in the third quarter matte running sweep breaks",0
"through and is met by al atkinson, a very underrated middle linebacker who played at villanova &gt;&gt; and also a fine play by ralph baker,",0
"number 51 he had an awful lot of interference they make the first down despite that, there was an awful lot of interference in front",0
"of ralph he forced it back to the inside and as curt gowdy called it, good insideoutside pursuit by number 62, al atkinson &gt;&gt; thats",0

"theyre on the new york 37 &gt;&gt; matte not a runner with brilliant speed, but you just pointed it out, how well he followed sullivan,",0
"just weaving right off of his backside, just following the angles, taking the opening &gt;&gt; unitas is moving the club 81, i think, is offside",0
"philbin, i believe, jumped gerry philbin beat the snap the balls on the 26yard line, where jerry hill carried it and i think theyll call",0
"this against philbin of the jets tried to get the quick charge johnny unitas says theyre going to take the gain, which gave baltimore a",0
"first down on the new york 26 &gt;&gt; and now, curt, heres a situation where number 87, willie richardson, who gave a big downandout move",0
"to john sample, could be a very significant receiver we might be looking for that post pattern &gt;&gt; baltimore now, as unitas has inspired and",0
"moving them throws the out pattern incomplete intended for willie richardson, number 87 and he was being covered by the safetyman, hudson, and then sample",0
"also they have not been able to hit richardson deep today in fact, baltimore has not been able to hit a deep pass today unitas",0

"and 7 al derogatis &gt;&gt; and a very big play coming up with just 10 minutes to go, this the last part of this football",0
"game if they get the first down, curt, you could figure the jets will eat up a minimum of two more minutes in that next",0
"series &gt;&gt; the clock moving baltimore needs two touchdowns and a field goal now heres a quick pitch to boozer they spring him, and he",0
"has a first down it looked like he just went across the 30, and he was hit there by dennis gaubatz and also by 85,",0

from memorial stadium in baltimore maryland national football action featuring the 1970 super bowl champions kansas city chiefs and the baltimore colts threetime champions of,0
the national football league nfl monday night football is brought to you by ford and johor dealer who invite you to come in and test,0
drive the 1971 ford the cars with the better ideas and buy marlboro filter cigarettes come to where the flavor is come to marlboro country,0
on the field here at memorial stadium quarterback of the baltimore coach johnny unitas water back to the kansas city chiefs len dawson with them,0
howard cosell leonard question number one i know it s early in the season but you did lose to minnesota you must regard this as,0
a mustwin game howard youre right even though it is early in the season it is a must game because we have yet to get,0
on the wind side and this is an outstanding football team were playing out here some degree ballgame inevitably the team wins the title everybody,0
shoots at them inevitably they say the hunger is gone as some of the spark left your club i dont think so of course in,0
a few minutes were going to find out but i think weve got it there we have a piece things together but hopefully hell come,0
tonight good luck to you and thank you very much for joining lenny dawson and now to the man who s been proclaimed the quarterback,0
of the decade and perhaps in the minds of many the greatest ever to play number 19 john unitas john yesterday at practice the left,0
knee squads and bandages and quite frankly a hyperextension that almost activated jim ward today and the thought that morrow would start tell us first,0
what is hyperextension well it s actually how would the knee being forced be in the wrong direction instead of on a hinge joint in,0
the hinge works one way and they try to make it work both way all right you have to set by pushing off the left,0
foot in order to throw the pack will youll be hindered tonight i dont think so the knee feels real well today is the swelling,0
is going and i have just about full amount of flexion in it and it s the biggest problem because i stretch out to try,0
to get back a little bit faster it just wont permit me to get back some of the would be experts have said you throw,0
the short one with all of the old brilliance but the ability to throw the long one is no longer there true or not true,0
where you have to ask the expert final question they say that the 70s will be the decade of the sprint out quarterback youre coming,0
i dont think so howard as valuable as a quarterback is i think they want him to stay back in the pocket where he has,0
the most protection occasionally he s going to get bit and theyre going to blitz occasionally they have to have the ability to move or,0
slide from one side to the other and going word is protection here honest printout he s he s left only one way to go,0
and that s basically the way he s printing out too and it makes it coverage myself superb defensive team youll face tonight the direct,0
effects i can figure good lucky again thank you very much john unitas and now very quickly let s meet our playbyplay announcer from whom,0
youve already heard keith jackson and keith i would think youd like to point up some of the big very great defensive stars well be,0
watching tonight allow it i think youre certainly right that we have some of the outstanding defensive football players in all of football tonight certainly,0
a house full of allpro you talk about kansas city defense you think buchanan you think you think the linebacking four headed by willa lanier,0
you think aaron brown was the sharp defensive secondary and of course baltimore s defense is led by the great bubba bubba smith also the,0
veteran fred miller and also one of the very fine defensive zone secondaries in all of football these quarterbacks i think will be tested tonight,0
all right now to our other colleague loose and easy with the magnificence of a texas drawl and a background in professional football at in,0
its time will be legendary dandy don meredith and dandy don you know how great these two teams are defensively how will the respective quarterback,0
attack them it s going to go lenny and john before the game it seemed that there was one word that they kept using well,0
have to be patient i know dawson feels that he must establish the running game first and that s quite true he thinks it s,0
a baltimore zone can be beaten theyd like to be satisfied with the short passes as far as you know im concerned he almost said,0
the same thing he said they have an odd fact defense is very difficult to run again ive got to take the short one you,0
know the good lord takes care of those who wait so well just find out tonight okay dandy the pregame activities are just about over,0

position ray perkins now leads the field but it is short of the first down up at the 28 yard line it will be fourth,0
down and two and baltimore will have to kick it away dave lee is in the lineup to do the punting and he led the,0
national football league in hunting last year at forty five point three the second time in his fouryear career and he has led the league,0
in fights he hangs it high allowing very good coverage the ball hits the ground and it is down as a 36 yard line put,0

on the field playing the game right now a scram they coach on the football team that won the super bowl game in 1970 second,0
down and eight yards to go for kansas city hall at their own 38 boston breaks again to mike garrett kansas city has a first,0
down at the baltimore 45 yard line and a great block on the left side to get the little guy from southern california luke tom,0
maxwell in the defensive secondary made the tackle for baltimore baltimore s front floor is bubba smith number 78 billy ray smith number 74 rezo,0
and number 76 and roy hilton number 85 the linebackers have bob grant number 51 mike curtis number 32 and ted hendricks number 83 that,0
s garrett again this time he has caught behind the line of scrimmage the lord is back to the baltimore 48 yard line a threeyard,0
loss and it was bob grant number 51 and roy hills a number 85 the folks who made the tackle in the defensive secondary for,0
baltimore the quarterback are charlie stoops number 47 tom maxwell number 42 jerry logan number 20 and rick both number 21 all the safety we,0
have no school we have just started the ball game kansas city in possession with a something little march moving from their own 36 at,0
it now second down and 13 as boston goes to the air for the first time he s going far left in 20 minutes he,0
s gonna push down 28 yards and kansas city is on the board let s take a look at richardson which took off on a,0
fly pattern it must have been a mixup to the defensive secondary eyes but he seemed like that way if it wasnt this just missed,0
him because he ran right by logan came over to scott excel for deep but he couldnt get there it also feels like he has,0
to run that was his first pass of the night not a bad way to started all right dinner road will try for the point,0
out of dawson cole it is good and so the kansas city key jump out in front of a baltimore colts 7 nothing here at,0
memorial stadium in baltimore maryland will be back to 4 in just a moment and spinner road will kick off for kansas city as the,0
chiefs go 64 yard in four plays and get on the board to lead 7 to nothing number 35 is jim duncan and number 30,0
is ron hardy they burn men for the blue clad baltimore folks been a rout kick as usual deep and the soul will take it,0
first in sam after 20 let s take another look in slow motion at the touchdown meredith i talking is all from earlier today he,0
felt that leaves old this side of the field of this hash mark the zone would be a weight we can get deep on baltimore,0
well have to go into the short side again i think it was a missed assignment because lutz was standing there kind of looking back,0
at the quarterback and it just ran light by logan almost made the play with a good throw and kansas citians now and put 7zip,0
let s see what johnny unitas can do about it first down 10 baltimore at their 20 at dorm bhulok football baltimore recovers gulag hit,0
hard gary hill who is in the ball game replacing the injured on that he had in the ball game primarily to block for johnny,0
unitas fell on the ball aaron brown was the man who listed bullish and knocked in luke second down and about 11 for baltimore from,0
there 19 united s espousals away the intended receiver fell down it could have shifted by johnny rotten back up to 35 and robertson is,0
left at the 24 roy jefferson the intended receiver fell and he went right into the hands of robinson will take another look take a,0
look at it i think he did fall down the pass just a little bit a little bit high he did see marcellus definitely a,0
good mood to get inside he did fall down i think the best with a little bit high anyway in robertson in the free safety,0
position but he s recognizes the best that there is question american football conference he picked him off like that for about 12 years johnny,0
brought his back 14 yards fall at the 25 yard line is just inside the 45 lenny dawson is the quarterback but hazen garrett behind,0
him and it s mike go zipping and getting to the line of scrimmage if burton five power that s johnny robinson on the bench,0
there s a theory around that the free safety has to be a helpmate to the cornerback has to be flipped and of course it,0
s good if he is with but robinson an advanced veteran belies that theorem above all what a free safety must have is knowledge ability,0
quick diagnosis of the opponent s offense and position second down bullets i guess mike garrett run yard on the last play richardson wide to,0
the right garrett move too soon in the kansas city back field the penalty flags all over the fear gain on the play about a,0
yard billy ray smith leading the tackler for baltimore this might not be necessary to fail to mention this but dawson missed missed me earlier,0
he said baltimore has to be one of the most difficult stadiums to play in because of the crowd noise and i dont know what,0
i was what through garret awfully on a heard to say no but it is a stadium that is been recognized in the league is,0
where the most difficult stadium to play in to kagra crowd noise and dawson says they have convinced their number of ottawa for this game,0
because of that very reason and there has not been an empty seat here in this stadium for a cold football game since 1963 the,0
cossacks entered the predator and they could second down and 14 for kansas city dawson has it before hills and after him the pass is,0
incomplete the pass intended for wendell hey one of the backs coming out of the backfield heavy price of that from number seven mclaurin rover,0
gifted veteran billy ray smith ill never play to get bit and ill tell you it they can say what youre worth you kids scared,0
quarterback you look at billy ray across that land and he s man he s mean and he s blowing we put up here was,0
i was real cold i said everything he s just any freeze in earnest smoke comes out of his mouth billy wright bennett right he,0
s good football player sit down in 44 kansas city the ball is at the baltimore 29 yard line welcome still hazard he swings at,0
the war in mcveigh who was sent into the ballgame at a running back position in mcveigh is down at the baltimore 22 yard line,0
it was fred miller number 76 in jerry logan who made the tackle for baltimore and that of course brings into the lineup and onto,0
the field number three john stehr ood of kansas city now the ball is at the 21 yard line and from that point mr skinner,0
ood is deadly his history shows that he is most successful from the distance 17 out of 21 outside the 20 yard line it is,0
history and this one is through the uprights and though the kansas city feat build their lead on a cool night in baltimore maryland with,0
time out our score again the city deep pen the baltimore cope nothing nice shot are they better probably i came to play wisconsin skinny,0
that s me what youre getting skittle full to us would help salesman tim duncan number 35 garden number 30 deep for baltimore kansas city,0
with nine minutes and 16 seconds to play in the first quarter leading 10 to nothing on this man 28 yard hell go and hell,0
kick it off the chiefs getting the jump in the first quarter he hits it deep into the corner for duncan this time duncan will,0
come up with and he comes well he is beyond the 25 baltimore s wall first in that after long 27 in or nearly wouldnt,0
be a good move were going to kick off back from that deep in the end zone but you know kansas city looks as if,0
theyre so used to say a sinner who ticking so deep folks all of them back to off and i think they kind of held,0
up a little bit about the 30 nothing brother died duncan bought it back 33 yards where was indeed a fine wind on johnny unitas,0
remains a quarterback goulash and hell set behind him it s bhulok flick just got him slows him down and then comes around and comes,0
linear then come bail and very made that s pretty well covers him up a six over losses back to the 24 yard line second,0
down and 13 goulash has lost six yards in precarious he was the top graph choice for the coast as unitas goes to throw as,0
time he goes over the middle of the pass intended to tighten john mackey is incomplete and guy robinson almost as howard cosell pointed out,0
in conversation with johnny unitas at the beginning tonight surely around was then the jaya does not have as much on the ball especially the,0
path outside 25 30 yards but i wouldnt want to bet a nickel on the center is bill curry georgia tech hit and jump wide,0
receivers both fred to the right side as unitas goes to fall and he s going down the sideline for jefferson boy scotty that was,0
right on the money actually they ruffled most of it pretty close you see thomas with jefferson you never close the vault just as he,0
comes out of his break george jefferson radio seven makes a great move pellets almost tipped it away perfect throw nice move good catch so,0
the next place 17yard pickup on the play first down baltimore at their own 42 keeps the leading 10 to nothing in the first quarter,0
759 the play and bhulok they big rookie running back carries to the 45 second mark off to the köppen buck you can and make,0
the tackle second thanks graham we will walk 15 miles probably before this game is over second down and 7 baltimore at their own 45,0
wholock he s got two maybe three yards before he runs into jim kearney coming over the top and curley cope on the bottom with,0
gerry made big boo they call in pieced the number one draft choice for the colts from tcu funny story came up with his agent,0
to negotiate on blossom in the coach general manager the agent said don this dogs ready to hook he patted klosterman on the knee and,0
ill finish the story after the play dollars at the 48 theyre down they need three unitas will chloe he blows dabula he is hit,0
by lynch but not before the sickest infectious six up the first down and just to finish the story wasserman made his offer and the,0
agent what s it done no longer patting him on the knee and begged on the dog aint gonna hunt but they reconcile he advances,0
to the 46 yard line kansas city territory the first penetration of kansas city country by the coats so far in the game we have,0
six 20 to play first quarter chiefly 10 nothing that agent could have been eight martynyuk coach deep he talked like that united all he,0
gives it off on the delay up the middle goes blue lon he weighs 200 mm from our town like 320 and he hit hard,0
oh he s got muscles on muscles this problem has been a whole series of nagging injuries so i was into collegiate career and his,0
very first couple of days and pennekamp says gary pulled a hamstring but he appears to be fine now he was brought down by curly,0
coach aaron brown on this way he picked up three yards bobby got muscles or muscles get up not sure they see you quit maris,0
and i said why i thought he was gonna say oh something nice but you only got a lead at skinnier legs than i do,0
that s true true you know second down seven wall at the kansas city 43 unitas under question that just passed away a beautiful role,0
by jefferson as he just flat with marcelo take another look at this one jeff just wanted a good pattern this appears to be a,0
takeoff for a fly rod you can see you know the set bro unit he looks back well he got one right the note from,0
marcellus and came back the ball was a little bit low but close enough made a good kit first half of baltimore and done i,0
think you want to point out that that bump between the two was perfectly legal yeah that s right it s the baltimore first down,0
at the kansas city 33 yard line the coast abuddin feel today hulahula lanier has him from the back first time he s in front,0
he s run to that right side i was finish to just been watching this he s run right at mckenna and brown that s,0
the first time he s going to the right side over there you ever cant tell what their game plan there s a lot of,0
times they got to go to a bigger man but canada brown and then noted to be little more difficult to run against at that,0
time he went to the right no punted gary mazin curly caught second down and eight foot baltimore right here s a kansas city 30,0
united the little quick pop over the middle to john mackey the big by dan and mehcad pulls his way down he one appears to,0
be a first down a very close to it what about the 21 maybe inside the 22 but it s right down in first down,0
territory hill unitas does that flow well it looked as if it might be a play that was called in the huddle but actually he,0
read the middle linebacker linebacker blitzing up the middle and when hed go you can see a mackey came right where he was and automatically,0
he throws one over center to the neck and what a play mackey is a lot of thing you know he s been rated the,0
best tight end ever to play the game but he has been behind in his training it was all involved leading the nfl players association,0
in that pension hassle a lot of people were so quick to say that maybe mackey isnt so great as once he was but i,0
suspect watching him tonight youll say he is john mackey as we watch and he is out of the game for a breather right now,0
as tom comes in at tight in and the handoff goes to the big pool on and big food jams it in for the first,0
down and he goes to the 18 you know tom mitchell was supposed to be hurt hobbling around on an ankle all week but here,0
he is full of exuberance into the ball game as they went through the two tight end for the power play up the middle they,0
always put in the two tight ends when theyre inside the 20 don mccafferty the coach of the baltimore clothes market on the 17 yard,0
line baltimore s ball first down hill and boulos remain the set back this time jerry hill jumper from wyoming gets it and he takes,0
it to the 14 yard line tinnitus is doing exactly what he wanted to do dandy done established the ground game thatll make this passing,0
game doubly effective obvious the drive sort of it a lot more effective in their first to attempt feedback they were a little hesitant there,0
theyre running in there blocking in it but you know kansas city has a way of doing that to the people they play theyre probably,0
the biggest people in in football there they walk did you see the time remaining and baltimore comes up second down and seven at the,0
14 yard line and the city s 14 both formerly united the floor oh no 10 bobby bell blitzing got it hard wow what a,0
player that bell is he s been talked about so many times and it s been said so often he could play any position india,0
s star one of the extraordinary athletes of our time moses back outside the 22 yard line i remember him at minnesota howard he was,0
some kind of ferocious when he played college football dominick take a look at it right quick now it comes up in fluff the blip,0
but they really want anybody there to block it and that does hurt third down and 15 for the baltimore folks and baltimore now takes,0
too much time they will lose five more that s too bad at kind of unusual this telecast presented by authority of the baltimore colts,0
football club intended to the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or other use of the telecast without the express written consent of the,0
baltimore colts football club and the national football league is prohibited on the third down and 20 baltimore ball is back at the 27 unitas,0
the floor looking for jefferson it was considered a fumble and kansas city comes up with a football that s exactly right the official it,0
does that the arm was not moving forward in which date that would have been adjudged to be a forward pass incomplete since it was,0
not moving forward it was the bumble and rule the court and kansas city has the football first and family at their own 26yard line,0
this is just jim marcellus residual that last play i saw him live off nfl monday night football continues from memorial stadium in baltimore maryland,0
with a score the kansas city chiefs 10 baltimore folks nothing take another look take a look at late will give the ball does have,0
a pass call he comes back to get the pressure of the inside is a really honest if the arm is in the motion of,0
the farm boys on the pass is considered on the forward pass this is a fumble marcellus picked it up youll see curry come across,0
that time it was aaron brown as you saw number 87 who applied the pressure and force the fumble dad the city ball first and,0
ten 26 ron mukbang number six and that way is hit by mike curtis number 32 middle linebacker for baltimore is give me marcellus we,0
recovered the fumble and stopped second our baltimore drive marcellus represents another old theory and pro football i used to say it couldnt win a,0
title with a rookie cornerback but marcellus is the rookie last year in a key man bolide that series no gain on the previous play,0
second down 10 kansas city there 26 lenny dawson the quarterback lauren mcveigh has it and his feet are cut out from under it as,0
he comes up across the 27 maybe gets to the 28 yard line fred miller the tackle watch the mod squad on a night 7:30,0
6:30 central time here on abc tom macavity they head coach to the baltimore colts in his first season stated don shula its third down,0
and nine for kansas city at the 27 number 30 gloucester richardson wide to the right frank fitts to the left they go to the,0
ground and give it to mike vey a nice move by lauren mcrae and he is close to a first down i was a super,0
move by late mike curtis made the tackle and we have come to the end of the first quarter here at memorial stadium our score,0
kansas city ten baltimore nothing we start the second quarter of play with kansas city leading baltimore by a score of 10 to nothing lenny,0
dawson the quarterback of keith and his mystical story in the first quarter that keeps that 10 offensive played in the first period baltimore 19,0
but a fumble stops of all the more drive at the close of the first period and here we go with kansas city owning the,0
football dawson wants to go deep and he does go deep for richardson i do it logan back at the 21yard line like that was,0
just a little bit underthrown let s take a look at it youve got rich trying to split the middle again he s got logan,0
and six back logan looks back the ball with a little bit short he made a very good interception gary logan who are the leading,0
interceptor on this baltimore club last year with four he s been a standout football player in the coke secondary fall at the 22 yard,0
line a handoff to boule black block and he takes it up to the ill get it right yes to the 23 yard line mike,0
garrett getting some medical attention he s a tough break kid hell be back very quickly that interception by logan was i think dandy a,0
perfect example of how the free safety can help the corner helping suit there did a good job ball is just short of the 23,0
called a second down and nine baltimore johnny unitas gets his pass away for jensen it kicked off by honey or robinson it s johnny,0
robinson again the free safety making his presence felt in the secondary robinson got it kearney was right there to help him he s trying,0
to go to jefferson again different comes across the middle of robinson was just plated robertson plays that water back as well as he can,0
and i cant emphasize how well he does play it i dont think john saw him then john followed the receiver all the way through,0
and robinson was playing the free safety position again it just cut across his club jefferson picked it off put him a great field position,0
well it s the 13 yard line first down and 10 robinson s intercepted two for a total of 41 yards and run back lenny,0
dawson rolling out get this pass away holmes back down anytime you see after a turnover the other team takes it in for a score,0
if he hopes of a 45 come out of the back field at the playaction pass talking dalton today he said to play action pass,0
the best on first down here s the first down the moving or the floating pocket he throws it right over the head and a,0
good catch by homehome pettit falling into the end zone and bobby was shaken up on the play and has left the field center ruth,0

quick pitch outs in tanana ron bull bull on the option pass lights out cause us to dick gordon he s alone in the corner,0
of the end zone the conversion is good and the bears later 17th and i now were in the fourth period the eagles struggling to,0
come back that s luckily bogus wide on a sweep getting good blocking running away for an extra two yards from that tackle he s,0
gained 10 and the eagles are coming back once again the handoff is to leave oh just look at that hole in the middle he,0
sings away from that stack look this through another and the touchdown is scored though is the conversion and it s chicago 17 philadelphia 16,0
bucks the bears add a field goal and they win it 20 to 60 this is tiger stadium and destroyed the lions about to go,0
against the bengals they dominate thoroughly this is the second period already there had 24 to nothing and the bengals quarterback sam white he is,0
blindsided by the safety blitz of dummy vaughn now cincinnati must kick what s the play closer fun is made the ball is apparently about,0
to roll dead surrounded by bengals but no the alert when barney picks it up your fastest under cincinnati defender goes down unhampered along the,0
sideline for 61 yards and a lions score that made it 31 the final a 38 to three routes detroit over cincinnati these are the,0

slower laurel did bring the coast back whether touchdown on the very final play of the half and well be back with more nfl action,0
right after this message the halftime statistics surprisingly even really in passing as earl morel came on to lead the baltimore fulton to a touchdown,0
and the story on morale passing if he came late in the second quarter he had seven out of eight 75 yards baltimore had the,0
edge in offensive plays and ball control but kansas city went for the ball and they had the big play from their defense and they,0
lead at halftime by a score of 31 to 7 and there is dodge macavity who has to be a troubled man remember that baltimore,0
beat kansas city in an exhibition game 17 to 3 and he s often cranking up on the sidelines in that game baltimore intercepting kansas,0
in a quarterback six times but they have not had that kind of success here tonight as the chiefs have bombed them and lead 31,0
7 now itll be most interesting to watch pearl moral he will start the second half when baltimore gets the football see what this man,0
of magic can do who can ever forget what happened in 1968 when he led the baltimore colts that man right there to the national,0
football league championship the baltimore colts will kickoff jim obrien will kick it away and going deep or kansas city will be ed podolak number,0
14 and or in mcveigh number 6 there s the rookie tim obrien of cincinnati he kicked three field goals for baltimore and led them,0
to victory last week in san diego in a tough ballgame this youngster from cincinnati it all rights themselves in college he was a great,0
receiver great wide receiver as well as kicker he is a rookie there are eight rookies on the baltimore team here we go over the,0
second half of play and obrien gets it very high and mcveigh s in the end zone about seven yards deep but he has a,0
hole up the middle and he almost got away jim duncan caught him by the shoulder pad and slowed him down and the folks put,0
him away at the 19 have relaxed man who put him down when you run it back from the end zone keith the test of,0
efficiency is to get past the 20 yard marker which began this case didnt happen to do but the teeth of the football and this,0
is one tough team this white ketchup football against with their defense well have to see what baltimore can pull out of a hat when,0
in if they get the football lenny dawson the quarterback they break off the power eye they give it a warren mcveigh and mcveigh is,0
up across the 20 to the 23 yard line for a four yard pickup and he was knocked down by rein a number 56 mike,0
courteous number 32 his primary job is to stop the run this time comes on the inside of buddy and he s so quick so,0

break through for a substantial gain he s got a 15 times the total of 33 yard jefferson is wide to the right as morale,0
goes to flow goes to the left side for eddie him and his thomas grabbed him and dragged him out of bounds at the 44,0
yard line first down baltimore in central forum on the sake of allah at 18 yard pickup on the pass play and earl morale is,0

24 yard line world after all goes for the in broad and completes the pass intended for any happiness thomas was right there girl feels,0
that me back straight back from the center on a path it gives him better vision into the secondary to see what type of movement,0
the defense what defense are in that particular play unitas feels he can get back quicker and if he turns a little bit and goes,0
back to pass he looks over his shoulder still pods read the defensive secondary i was doing a very fine job im isolating one receiver,0
on one defensive back it s the primary objective in the passing game that gets one man or one man second down in town for,0
the blue plaid baltimore folks at home packed house world of roll looks with jefferson aaron brown and buck buchanan let s take a look,0

the ball to have relaxed cover like jerry mayes makes the tackle on the youngster from bucknell maybe 1/2 yard second people have asked me,0
in the past how much difference does it make when you get when you play in a field that has the face ball diamond when,0
you get down on the dirt it makes a great deal of difference in my opinion on the running game it s a handicap to,0
the defensive backs they try to keep up with a receivers morale to throw luke zip jefferson touchdown no he s not about no sir,0

caught by roy jefferson at the 30 yard line the flag went down before the ball was released marcellus covering jefferson it appears in kansas,0
city was offside keith imagine earl trying to decide whether he wants to take the five yards and give him another down or take the,0
pass perception i think that was short for the first down yard short decisions decisions to see ha i dont think im steve ball is,0
put down at the 34 yard line as morale does except the penalty to make a third down and five yards to go for the,0
first down mike livingston franken up for kansas city who may be in at quarterback on the next three in the backfield there was movement,0
jack maitland moving before the snap of the ball that drew all the penalty flags the pass was incomplete the youngster a rookie from williams,0
college number 23 obviously he ger passing back in motion why now itll be fourth down and five yards to go for baltimore as kansas,0
city declines the penalty sam never lacked goes into the backfield for baltimore replacing maitland 1256 to go in the ballgame the chiefs thrown 541,0
10 fourth and five the coax was try to get it laurel to throw get this pass away to have relax he is hit at,0
the 29 and he is thrown back he will be close to the first down he could not flushed the body ahead haha jim honey,0

denver and keith we neglected to mention at halftime the denver is fun baby to an o and kansas setting the text blue saban s,0
vastly improved broncos as you can see baltimore s just that much short of the first down and kansas city it takes over the ball,0
the coke will be in boston next week and next monday night we will be in detroit to see a couple of those undefeated teams,0
the bears and the lions mike livingston is now in the ballgame for kansas city number 10 on at quarterback six for 210 threeyear man,0
from smu morris crowd number 88 he s in at a tight end position and bobby holmes does open one fumble and baltimore recovers oh,0
brooke it from the 29 of our thoughts midfield lost the ball at the baltimore at the 49 yard line and the folks come up,0
with it and it looked like number 74 billy ray smith the 12 year veteran from arkansas was on the ball 12 minutes to go,0
in the game baltimore has their own 49 moral gives the ball to bowl 50 yard line 1 yard on the play a pretty good,0
example of the seed that bobby bell has you saw him comes in the linebackers position and blue license run a 9 5 or 9,0
600 and he cutting the outside bell was with himself percept they are not spending defensive play who lost was carried 14 times of the,0
game 34 yards second down nine baltimore midfield morel looking deep rose for mackie kearney defending the pass incomplete flag on the field sandy davis,0
junior guest stars with danny thomas in the new comedy hit make room for granddaddy wednesday night at 8:00 7:00 central time here on abc,0
that leads against the colts 1122 to go in the game gerry maze number 75 indicating once that he wanted the penalty now rural morale,0
says something that stops any movement you and go the other way so the penalty flag was thrown against kansas city and it moves it,0
to the 35 yard line where it will be baltimore s ball first and ten first of all i dont they against kansas any number,0
33 in the game for baltimore as hampton wide receiver earl morel statistical story jefferson is wide right laurels fast intended for mackey is incomplete,0
jim kearney covering the big crowd yelling for interference covered by karen a matter of fact john mackey s got a couple of words about,0
it talk about this crowd there s a feeling of disbelief which i feel from this crowd like this is not the kind of game,0
i expected i dont think this is the kind of game anybody expected baltimore has not played very sharp tonight gadget city s been in,0
control of the games that s the very beginning and i dont think the fans are that plays with their hometown crew tonight second down,0
and 10 for baltimore 88 is 1915 is morale deficit of white of the right laitanan boulanger setback oil to throw if this pass away,0
almost picked off by kearney intended from becky that would have been another one we had a clear field ahead of them youre right about,0
the baltimore fans done but putting the whole thing into perspective paula moore had tough going they had to play catchup football they started john,0
unitas who was in fan is hampered by the bad name now the fans are booing both the officials and to a degree their own,0
team earlier they booed john unitas himself and i hate to see that happen yeah you really do john s a great player no question,0
about that and he didnt have a good night and there s no question about that but neither is uh anyone else for baltimore as,0
far as id go they really havent played that well third down defense the boats the morale phase control loop the deep for perkins and,0
it is in between double coverage is william victor walk top twenty three was back there along with johnny robin so it brings up fourth,0
down for baltimore at the kansas city 35 yard line we thought about playing a good game or a bad game you know it s,0
oftentimes overlooked that the bad game seemed to come when youre playing against real good football players that might have something to do with it,0
a lot of good ones out there in white ill tell you that baltimore having handle them well in the exhibition game got to be,0
a little stunned by the way theyve been dominated here in the game seems to dancing and prancing and almost offside morals passes away at,0
pop by eddie hit i think youd have to say any hinton s had a good night he had a good night i like him,0
catch them in a crowd and he caught this one in the crowd he ran into the rulinea number 63 the down an end pattern,0
or cross pattern you see thomas number 18 coming in from behind him and in the air how much smallness pushes him and causes more,0
momentum as they run into linear i dont think the near moves in it awfully strong middle linebacker a twoyear man from oklahoma eddie messing,0
up top 7 for 89 yards bhulok get back to the line of scrimmage maybe and that s all and that is big aaron brown,0
number 87 getting up off the top of it a faster hinton was good for the first down i think when hitman was at oklahoma,0
playing in the big 8 oklahoma out of the 8 teams in the big 8 was number 7 in past attempts and yet he led,0
the conference in past receptions which is indication that he s been a good receiver for some time he caught 60 passes between a year,0
for very close to the thousand yards who lost is out of the backfield for baltimore and jerry hill is then replacing him at a,0
setback position is morale on 2nd and 11th rosehips touchdown if the call is against kansas city the penalty flag is on the field it,0
was against kansas city that was a beautiful throw another good route by hinton so it s a sixth quarter for baltimore alright and here,0
that young fella from oklahoma comes again youll see thomas if he has his hands going that s all right there when he got him,0
simply turn you grab his shoulder pad a little bit and that is their first call but it didnt call him and then it was,0
a good throw by morale and weve got six points on the board for baltimore and the second touchdown pass of the night for earl,0
morale 939 to go in the game jim obrien is in it has not bought eight for 110 yards and a touchdown and obrien kick,0
is straight through the uprights so we have a timeout at memorial stadium baltimore with a sore now kansas city 41 baltimore 17 the man,0
who uses this club is a crow he s brooks robinson of the baltimore orioles a pro who s played third base in every allstar,0
game since 1960 ask this bro who he sees about own car and business insurance and hed tell you be the pro i say about,0

eastern daylight time ole miss and alabama on abc one of the great college matthews of any football here on sidekick hope have it and,0
he is down at the 22 yard line but theyll bring it back to the 44 where he picked it up you want the antenna,0
one than that done beautifully executed every time the reason is brought back as the ball can not be as advanced unless it is touched,0
by receiving beam first again covered the ball is baltimore s vault it seems as if they forgot about the onside kick on that one,0
because it isnt anyone covering part both has great speeds was a beautiful onside kick and now baltimore has a little brandnew breath of life,0
9 minutes and 14 seconds left to play in the ball game in the girl mode goes to work maze of ephraim and brown gets,0
him in early cope is in the middle so brown talked and made were all coming let s the sometime tonight brown has been in,0
there to get the quarterback and talking about that onside kick tim obrien yesterday morning at the baltimore practice came over the sidelines just a,0
moment picked up some footballs and said to the general manager gun klosterman im going to spend the next 20 minutes practicing onside kicks and,0
so he didnt it paid off here hard work always pays off a loss of 8 yards on the play lay perkins number 27 in,0
replacing mackie has come to the left side as the wide receiver tomorrow back to throw from the 48 lost it downfield for perkins perkins,0
wap open a penalty flag is down another airfares all against willie mitchell very aggressive young man number 22 for kansas city you want to,0
make that ball club and he s out there hidden i think theyve called defense is holding up in front everything and i thought i,0
did such a great job splitting up at benefit if they would do that with me ill tell you willie hit him a pretty good,0
shot as he came down the sideline so let s take a look at it town hall take a look at it here as you,0
watch the contact all right here he comes and that is a holding building hey you know what so glad somewhere that happened cause it,0
gives me a chance to mention tents there s a difference between defensive holding and defensive pass interference the ball had not been in the,0
air i suppose and he grabbed him at five yards automatic first down the ball given some maintenance and the youngster from williams college prints,0
all the way down to the 22 yard line 26 yards on the run by jack maitland and thomas brought him down eight minutes and,0
28 seconds to play in the ball game baltimore storming back here in the fourth quarter theyve got a long way to travel theyll take,0
a big storm they put the ball down at the 23 where mapelen was shoved out of bounds another first down for the coat the,0
linebackers were coming morale gets his pass away right into the hands of jefferson and then it is knocked loose in a beautiful defensive play,0
by johnny robinson or was it myself the swede lee gets up it s marcellus marcellus left his arms around him and jarred it loose,0
so marsalis leaves limping some took a pretty good ball and looks just definitely have come down on him when they both fell together second,0
down and baltimore to kansas city 23 that is any hit on the reverse and eddie hatton who has been quite a performer tonight is,0
down right around the 12 yard line excellent job by thomas as he came in from behind the interference that he had to slow hinton,0
s down enough it did have some blockers out in front of him the second other look out here comes hitting number 33 around you,0
can see the blockers out of fun there s thomas number 18 it slowed hit and then and they will be kansas city pursuits pursuit,0
to catch up with it i like the way maitland and handed off to him though that maitland has come in there and as keith,0
mentioned he s from williams he s a playoffs 12 yard line first down baltimore kansas city swells fast in and out of the hands,0
of wacky and there s a penalty flag on the field again kearney was the defender for kansas city against the teeth holding all internal,0
teams against stanford your seats thomas wright owning first off and there again he s got the division holy he s pushing and pulling impact,0
there s a big difference between a holding defensive holding an interference billy penalty is the holding field he is only a fiveyard penalty wall,0
is right about the seven yard line to hand off the maitland he s fighting oh look at him put up a battle and the,0
defensive in a fierce building i was going to tell you about is whatever whatever the infraction occurs that s where the ball is marked,0
so that distance could be any number of yards depending on how far down bill the interference till the occurred the defensive holding bility is,0
only a fiveyard penalty jack maitland took the ball so they for a yard line moving at three yards and as he emerged from the,0
dust storm number 84 tom mitchell who has been hobbling on a floor ankle is in at five an and mitchell was scheduled to start,0
had he not been hurt maitland again into the middle short of the goal line society6 1 to 10 upton bill the personnel director saying,0

story going on before that gives you better ideas for less 41 the 24 and the city leading baltimore six minutes and three seconds to,0
play in the game as jim obrien he s it up to kick it off in warren mcbaine number six along with bobby holmes is,0
deep for kansas city i think you can look for earl morale probably to get the starting call next week for the coach onside kick,0
and marsalis covered at the 39 yard line for kansas city back on the pipe and there s sam ball one of the veteran offensive,0
tackle for baltimore during some of the wear and tear of the night and the time remaining penalty flag down automata go again they kansas,0
city chiefs theyre offside but a long way the ball of the feet up on a 45 yard line in the fourth quarter kansas city,0
has had only two offensive plays baltimore has had in the fourth quarter 22 five following the news tonight be sure to watch the dick,0
cavett show dick s guest this evening norman mailer dick cavett following the news like they at homes are creeping up they dont really expect,0
obrien to hit this one he goes to the onside kick it s got to go ten yards and it did not travel six yards,0
so that s the penalty against baltimore seeing pam ball on the sidelines while ago points up a fact that jerry mays and always been,0
playing in front of or across from all night jerry s an outstanding game for kansas city their defensive line defense is capped in a,0
10year veteran with the chance of city chiefs done a fine job ball will move back to the 40yard line now and 555 remaining the,0
play on the game why im kicking off on the point now let s see what jimmy can do this time you can hear the,0
cajun city players say look for the old sidekick window hayes grabbed it and drops at the 45 yard line one delay johnny unitas on,0
the sideline five mike livingston number ten the quarterback lenny dawson apparently threw for the night let s lightning strike to the baltimore very quickly,0
crowd the big site in shifting out of the bhakti a total act he s tough he goes to the baltimore 43 yard line before,0
tom maxwell gets him down is tough he s the guy who said when he was a member of the college also as a year,0
ago when they played the get that the guests were a bunch of fat old men he stuffed with the mouse as well as the,0
body well his out of the 41 15 yards on the play he s been working all week that wide receiver in case you might,0
be needed there because of the injured older sailors they havent missed otis very much so far tonight bobby home it s just inside the,0

hair for years unitas isetta had a crew cut no solvents bobby boyd the coach was a baltimore colts bobby does not much hair at,0
all and he was comparing his hairdo was you know you know unitas now has to comb his and i still just wipe mine off,0
with a rag second down and eight that s just inside before t call it 239 livingston the floor mike curtis alright it curtis just,0
missed him and coming in from the other side billion newsome number 81 a lot of blue jerseys that backfield that man we bit encourage,0
many times tonight but mike is an outstanding middle linebacker this is a blitz where he comes off the move the defensive tackles he taken,0
a good thrown p donal mike livingston from southern methodist university and newsome comes in to put the finishing touches on it this is sort,0
of pretty good lick from bubba smith if he came across to help lost his back to midfield nine yards third down and 19 for,0
kansas city he s the 41 44 the 339 to play at portal act and it gets back to the 40 dawn moore came with,0
her linebackers that time to baltimore a few years ago was known as a very high blitzing team theyve list a great deal in talking,0
with dawson this afternoon he says they really dont do that anymore unless theyre behind they blitz an average of like 15 percent which is,0
not uncommon lehigh without imagine he s on the point his last quarter youll see the toe splits quite a bit on fourth down and,0
nine stena route is in the ballgame for kansas city he will try a 47yard field goal it s good 47 yards sinner ooh hit,0
one more and that runs the store up to 44 24 remember saturday night on abc 9:30 eastern daylight time abc ncaa football ole miss,0
and alabama from jackson mississippi archie manning and scott hunters the rebels in the crimson tide one of the great college game of any football,0
team john skinner ou s from 47 yards make the kansas city 44 baltimore 24 and quite a story from a young man who came,0
over to montana state university there s some heat jumping from norway and became one of their most efficient field goal kickers of all time,0
johnny unitas down cast on the sidelines i was looking at the statistics on center road he was 23 out of 23 from inside the,0
20yard line sardine returning to kickoff for baltimore come back to the surface theyll get into the 31 yard line maybe back alive so kickoff,0
return and but they turn then amazed me you know they they have a running stride or a style all their own it s unique,0
talent to do that i guess mainly it s just take the ball and run as fast as you can and hard as you can,0
earl morel is the quarterback it s wide to the left morel wants to throw and throws for him and any sunny varkey down he,0
was down before the ball came loose this is excellent fast earl actually throws the ball in a hole youll see hit and come down,0
again with thomas defending hit and comes back across the middle there s some linebackers but overall this is a very difficult pass to throw,0
you see the linebacker jump that was lynch in front the ball came right in and it made another fair find reception we have a,0
timeout with two minutes to play in the ball game and our score kansas city 44 baltimore 24 while most of you like the tate,0
s the benson &amp; hedges 100 some of you really appreciate the 3 4 maybe even 5 moments more they give you 3 4 maybe,0
even 5 moments more than king size this is big al hirt saying that you need only two things when you go fishing lots of,0
miller high life and a little bit of luck hey look at that man big dad that deserves a miller hearty robust eat down good,0
bill a highlight champagne of beers that last cat for 23 yards gives that he had a total of nine receptions for the night 132,0
yards and a touchdown and the story on our own moral you see earl came on late in the second quarter and it s been,0
effective first down at the kansas city 47 yard line moral clothes intended for perkins it is intercepted by emmett summer he s hobbling along,0
and he is finally knocked out about that is the fourth interception the second for thomas they have pulled a charlie hart to look like,0
on his legs you made his cut there i get to report all that a minute earl got a little pressure from the defensive line,0
they were close then on a little bit look like he released it s possibly a little bit high the ball may have taken off,0
while they were floated a little bit it did go the head of his intended receiver you do that against this kansas city secondary youre,0
going to get it picked off the ball is on the 37 yard line kansas city first down and there s them at thomas wolfe,0
theyre playing with that knee yeah sure livingston the quarterback odor lack get the yard in it some say a loss of this fellow would,0
really be a loss in anybody s secondary and he is a fine football player i didnt see him get hit on that knee possibly,0
he may have turned it as he made his cut i hope it s not as me and just a charley horse you work those,0
things out those knees they take quite a while second down and nine at the 38 for kansas city livingston number 10 quarterback bobby home,0
after about the 14 and fred miller calls time defensive captain so baltimore spends one of its precious time out with 58 seconds to go,0

of the browns as an opponent well naturally theyve been one of the most consistent teams in the nfl over the years theyre very difficult,0
football team to run out of time but we kind of think we can beat them tonight they write a lot of zone coverage they,0

you about bill nelson with the browns and joe namath with a new york jets in my opinion theyre both leaders but they do lead,0
in a different way bill nelson is a consistent leader of the cleveland browns who have been known in the past two decades and probably,0
the most consistent football team in football he utilizes a fine running game with more than an adequate core of receivers on joe namath side,0
youve got a fella who can do things which his team feels no one but joe willie can do and you know what it might,0
be interesting to think you know i dont think nelson could quite do it to do quite as good a job with the jets as,0
he is with the browns nor do i think namath to do quite as good a job with the browns as you can with the,0

on the sweep hickerson in front of it a lap concerns the first man through the lead the defensive plays for the jets and that,0
s number 22 that came into your picture from his safety position jim hudson he has had so many knee operations i dont think he,0
remembers all of it that s my pond i think what he did a fine job of turning that thing back yet on a sweep,0
defensive back or a linebackers main responsibility has turned the ball in turned the ball carrier back in and that s what he did hakonsen,0
did his job too by coming over to fill to the outside kelly lost to a couple of yards back inside the 30 to the,0
29 where it is third down and eight for cleveland nelson to throw looks for colin passes in complete a penalty flag shannon was there,0
and collins was there and you see the indication pass interference well look at it again a lot of times this will happen when a,0
defensive back gets a little too aggressive these guys are certainly aware of colin s ability youll see hudson coming over to help and there,0
s what youd call past interference but the important thing there was colin s beating number 21 steve 10 and that s one of the,0
key matchups tonight on the touchdown play they had flipped collins over the other side that s why thomas was the one who got buffalo,0
the interference fall gives cleveland the ball first down and 10 at their own nelson rows four columns he is prepped hannah theyre all against,0

first quarter cleveland has the ball second down and goal just inside the new york 2 oh stop touchdown in talking to nelson before the,0
game this is actually inaudible he s that s anna brown formation or the fullback right behind the center and he did see a gap,0

the 40yard line for half just inside walter johnson and jerry shirk the defensive tackles makes the play for the round up till now the,0
jets have had very little chance to move the football cleveland ran 18 offensive plays in the first quarter to only eight for the jets,0
that s what cleveland wanted to do play ball control and thus keeps the ball away from joan namath ball is at the 40yard line,0
second down and a short for namath defoe going deep for sour come please mike paulo number 34 and walt some remember 29 beautiful away,0
that free safety dandy done mike now from grambling college helped out sumner there that s what theyre going to have to do to stop,0
namath you know joe mentioned in his pregame comments that this is what cleveland tries to protect against most of all is the long past,0
and there was a containment type defense i also thought sumner did a fine job in his area coverage third down and four or the,0
new york jets after cleveland 40 jerilyn boozer are set behind them sour and it s now over the left side people live great blocking,0
on the left side roger binny number 61 really helped out as they opened the hole or mr snell and he s down to the,0
30 that s the first down we have a penalty flag on the field you may have hit a little bit late the foul occurring,0
or to the ball that s inside the 30yard line which will mean half the distance to the goal the 14 personal by football the,0

berman is inside the town before sumner gets him a powerful man number 41 it s probably been said many times but and then sweep,0
is not and then sweep without those guards and if you dont believe me ask any running back matson l has led the new york,0
jets in rushing five times since he joined them second round for cleveland nine yard line jefferson bozer was hit by john darlington at the,0
7yard line the jets in order to get a first down ive got just about before it is third down and three for new york,0
at the cleveland center that s now he s got the first down from the end zone ville tech and have a look at it,0
if he has the ball to snell the outside linebacker that is usually there was out the front of the wide receiver don maynard snell,0
made a good cut came back through actually was a man old man zone block self snell just picked this hole did a fine job,0
digging up the first down that s carried six times for 36 yards first and goal to go at the two for the jet down,0
right now i want to say that in that drive the jets did what joe namath told us he was going to do he was,0
going to keep running right at number two jerry shirt the rookie from oklahoma state and on that whole drive dandy done that s what,0
they did yeah you know they tell me they better watch those shirt though he was some sort of a bigtime college wrestler and he,0
is a rookie and this is what you got to do is check him out he s got some help in there they did a,0
director attack attack toward him let s see if he was covers it this next drive jim turner out of dirt showers hole almost always,0

s kick off into the end zone deep into the end zone and reese morrison will have nothing to do with it itll be cleveland,0
ball first in town at their own 20 good kick by jim turner who today reached substantial agreement on his contract terms with ewbank let,0
s take a look at this touchdown from the end zone youll see number 32 emerson boozer the play was designed to give the effect,0
that he was going outside what youd call an inside trap he saw the guard pulling that s a trap block folks when he comes,0
across he s looking to trap somebody that s hit him from the blind side the cleveland browns go to the offense shifting out of,0
the i formation that bill nelson number 16 in their number 65 is john dmarie the guard nelson the throw gets it away guess what,0
there almost picked off im one of those charging new york defense atlanta johnelliott number 80 berlin biggs number 86 steve thompson number 85 and,0
mark loomis the rookie number 84 all came pouring in this will be a testing sequence for the new york jets keith because theyve shown,0
offensive resiliency that back in the ball game but theyve got to contain cleveland and they havent yet forced to turnover of the football in,0
this contest and the two rookies remain at the cornerback positions number 21 steve tenon and number 45 early thomas howard they need to get,0
in their second win but now though i see what bill nelson does hell throw it again he looks for collins he froze instead up,0
the middle intended for morin and a laugh concern and ralph baker the two linebackers have dropped back and they pinched him and the past,0
is incomplete third down and ten coming up for the cleveland browns they lead 14 to 7 nelson now 5 for 8 ennis passing for,0
75 yards and he threw for one of the touchdown 11 minutes and 55 seconds to play in the first half the browns scored first,0
on a 55 yard march 9 plays nelson hidden calling and then both scott ran it in from two yards to make a court see,0
nothing the judge came back to drive 61 yards and make it a 147 game here in the first half at 11:55 to play nelson,0
the throw wide open to the 45yard jim hudson made the back these films will show a lot to the other teams coming up to,0
play the jets let s take a look at it now you see steve 10 and that s on gary coming thomas has taken him,0
deep there s a fine example of your bumpandrun but we didnt see was milt lauren dragging in behind him a drag he went down,0
about 15 yards and cut to the outside and hutch ahead a little bit too much room to cover there fine call fine throw nelson,0
hit hard on that play ball down just shy of the 45 yard line penida clock down immediately from the referee kelly kelly has rolled,0
out of bounds by ralph baker so the new york jets defensive captain al atkinson will visit with referee norm schachter here there or kelly,0
now coming up to join the conversation but he is not welcome theyre probably calling leroy for illegal motion were moving before the snap you,0
know there s a guy that just looks like he s moving a lot because he does move so quick well see that s what,0
the call was so i guess maybe he was that time he s awful quick though referee all has moved back just inside the 40yard,0
line first down and 15 for the brown the former trojan from usc bill no well back number 43 fair hooked it at sun devil,0
from arizona state coming off to the left side gary collins both wide receivers on to the left side they give it to both scott,0
before back and there s no daylight new york jets defensive front four came crashing in and berlin big was right there to really mess,0
it up our column and also in the ball game in the 48 that defensing the browns much better on the ground the point of,0
vulnerability has been unfortunately from the jets point of view jim hudson because of the damage knees it s only a matter of time till,0
gus holloman came in there second down and 17 for cleveland for his tight end no but holloman was all over you our number 48,0
is polymer it stands reasonably you gonna check hauling out real quick see if you can cover itll be third down and 17 for the,0
cleveland brown all back just inside the 39 yard line third down 16 the score is 14 to 7 and there s gus holloman number,0
48 will they see a lot action before this ball game is over instead of jim hudson it s tough to take that knife eight,0
times on your knees third down 16 is nelson goes deep rollin biggs his back but he gets the pass away two more in completed,0
midfield larry grantham linebacker and holloman makes the play for the jets in the secondary but this will be the first turnover the first time,0
cleveland s failed to sustain a drive itll be fourth down and five yards to go for the cleveland browns and don cockroft is in,0

he was a heavyweight wrestling champion at oklahoma state they missed the flow on second down and eight he s got sally wide open saw,0
his duff hard by kellerman but he s got the ball for a first down i think it could they poured it out there s,0
been a lot of talk about what is the zone and that s when the halfback plays though let s take a look at it,0
here on isolated go see sour go to the outside and joke those right in the hole kellerman responsibility on a zone defense he s,0
the strong safety is to keep him from getting deep so he rolls very deep to the outside was sumner coming up on the short,0
side that was a beautifully executed pass 17 yards on the play first down new york at their own 32 namath three out of six,0
in passing 46 yard joe will flow again going deep down the sideline salaries there he s but it new york s la push down,0

of steps on waltz under and that s all you need with joe willie throwing and i want to tell you number 41 matt snell,0

the and into the huddle after a brief conference with his coach weve eubank we have a change in the cleveland secondary freddie summers a,0
twoyear man from wake forest number 20 is now in the secondary the new york jets have the football first and ten at the cleveland,0
28 yard line the browns are leading 14 to 7 with 8:05 to go in the first half namath the pro over the middle of,0
a shower a great defensive play by walt sumner saved a touchdown walk angry because he thought he might have intercepted as a penalty market,0
down on that play and it s going to be a big one against the jets for offensive home and an angry man next monday,0
night kansas city at baltimore as you watch nfl monday night football on abc the jets have been penalized five times for 69 yards so,0
far on the game its first down and a half for new york from the cleveland 49 to emerson boozer slowed up at the line,0
of scrimmage perhaps he made it to the 48 jack gregory the man wholl get credit for the tack the story on namath so far,0
in the ballgame the ball is at the cleveland 48 just outside the 48 yard line the jets in order to get the first down,0
ive got to go to about the 18 yard line and there s the time remaining in the first half sommers has left the game,0
now and macao has returned at safety for cleveland nameís pass for maynard he s got it up to 32 and he is dropped right,0
there by a rich barn take a look at where don maynard it is just as the ball gets there this all was throw away,0
before he turned this is attending ears barnes is a veteran as fiddly for several years but this is the type timing between a quarterback,0
of the receiver that just really cant be stopped an excellent role an excellent excellent catch it is third down and 14 yards to go,0
for the new york jets at the cleveland browns 32 yard line emerson bozer im garlington finally runs him down and what a run by,0
number 32 and what a superb individual effort and what a call with leap you bank probably responsible he likes to use that kind of,0
call on third down and long yardage it s a surprise even as paul brown used it to train jesse phillips loose for 76 yards,0
yesterday on cincinnati s behalf against oakland bozhe picked up 15 yards on the play one yard more than the jets needed for the first,0
down they now have the ball first and ten at the cleveland 17 yard line the clock shows 616 let s listen to the call,0
by now that snail in the middle penalty flag fits right into the pile maddis backed up at about the 16 yard line by jerry,0
shirt number 72 offensive holding the ball is back at the 31 yard line 90 yards so far for the jet named apple pro he,0
goes deep kiss our sinner somewhere brings it back to the poor hey it s a great move by sundar he s right with sorry,0
didnt go as soured inside faked if i was a little bit overthrown look at him he went up about three feet over sauer and,0
he knows something someone to do with it when he gets involved ocp firma to get a pretty good shot number 67 but i imagine,0
he feels like it s worth it do your man from florida state well similar with a big defensive play for the number 85 is,0
wide to the left side is bill nelson get the ball over leroy kelly and kelly his quarter on the ankles by linebacker larry gentlemen,0
good to play by john elliott that thought last time as he ducked off the leading guards messed up to play in the backfield once,0
again a testing sequence for the jets defense because the jets were really moving theyre back in the ball game they were threatening figure to,0
get at the very least a field goal then had the interception kelly lost two yards on the play a second down and 12 from,0
the 38 yard line for cleveland this time homer jones and fair hooker the wide receivers are both on the right side bill nelson gives,0
instead on the short side to leroy kelly and kelly cannot do it right there to nail him down with big helping out and early,0
thomas if i might add keith s number 45 the rookie playing uptight and turning that back has done meredith described earlier watch the defensive,0
rush here well get a good idea how strong berlin s biggs and larry grantham are they fit it off some pretty good size to,0
us to get back there grantham is recognized throughout the league is and there s early thomas coming in kind of seal things up grantham,0
is probably most active or were the most active outside linebackers in football got a third down and 16 for cleveland just outside their 34,0
yard line theyll nelson to throw under the rush gets his pass away battle with steve cannon and a pen goes into the air in,0
a hurry i think this one is against the offensive player fair hooker he was pushing off on dinner i think here s pam hooker,0
you seem there was old fair hooker right there but in the middle of the line there was defensive holding and it s an automatic,0
first down whether weve been play there was defensive holding cuz i didnt see any often fall is outside the 38 yard line so far,0
these penalties are incredible 95 yards against the jets 15 against the cleveland browns four minutes the play in the first half as nelson goes,0
to throw wants to go deep he s got hooker wide open that is a little bit too long he had holloman and cannon beat,0
cold so theyll nelson reaching for the long women for the first time tonight almost had one theyll now 7 for 12 in is passing,0
417 yards you know homer jones came over here to cleveland everybody thought he would just step into a wide receiver job but this young,0
man from arizona state had other things on his mind and he took the starting job there you see the time remaining in the first,0
half on the grounds leading by a score of 14 to 7 second down and 10 cleveland from their own nelson under the rush gets,0
his pass away it is incomplete intended for fear hooker and coming across with a jarring defensive play is the rookie speed cannon let s,0
take a look at john eliot as john is playing off a couple of blockers reminiscent of bob lilley we wouldnt used to watch the,0
game fields at home he makes the move he s actually going to be the man that forces nell from the throw and he still,0
makes the play quarterbacks love guys like eliot he s got to be about as quick as any defensive lineman youll ever see i think,0
we should also know however now i was talking earlier about bill nelson had a an ear problem as a matter of fact he had,0
the minor surgery on his ear earlier this week third down and ten play bleeding from there thirtyeight well then biggs has got a shot,0
and he gets him just as he releases the ball and the past is well under he intended target milk laura so bill nelson really,0
took a shot from berlin bigs coming from the blind side that time and cleveland will have to kick it away not at all happy,0
about it but he s not happy with his pass blocking not happy with berlin bigs that did what he s supposed to do this,0
saturday on abc ncaa college football penn state and colorado at 4:00 pm eastern daylight time and ill guarantee you there will be some hitting,0
in that one they will play it in boulder too deep men for new york number 40 is mike battle number seven is jeff bell,0
rock rocks cut high twisting spiral edie bell calls fair catch at the 23 yard line and there the jets will have it first and,0
10 with 3:38 to play in the first half fl number seven is a rookie from idaho state they list him at 160 pounds in,0
510 and i think that s probably after he puts a couple of rocks in his pocket or right after lunch but he can really,0
fly of course the jets of west with great speed at virtually every position joe namath sets and hell go to work first and ten,0
from the 23 and leave white the setbacks and he throws it to leave white and a penalty flag is again on the field as,0
white getting the ball across the 32 to 32 he picked up about nine yards but let s watch the penalty it appears that it,0
is again against the new york jets dandy done the way theyre going theyll be lucky to get off the field with the store the,0
way it is the offensive infraction by the new york jets cost them 15 big yards from the line of scrimmage and move the football,0
all the way back to the 12 yard line that s 106 yards now for the jets as namath fires from rayner then gets him,0
at the 29 and don makes it just outside the 30 he rich barns number 40 on the tackle for cleveland namath is now using,0
maine as well on e respond who is as dunn pointed out earlier a veteran who listed at 35 years of age the meantime the,0
jets of stuff at 110 yards and penalties in the browns 15 yards two minutes and 35 seconds to play in the first half it,0
is second down and two yards to go all the jenner for the first down as namath goes quickly to george sour and sour skips,0
out of bounds up at the 37 maybe the 38 yard line and that will be enough for a new york first down walt sumner,0
covering for cleveland was commonly referred to as a percentage past this one is right on the money again again the cleveland browns rolled into,0
his own coverage or a double coverage to the strong side of the field and joe reddy s defense as well it came back to,0
sour for a first down namath is now eight out of 12 in passing for 129 yards hell throw it again intercepted by jim houston,0
the middle linebacker and he picks it down 27yard a superb play by houston there s nobody better at that his first year at middle,0
linebacker he was a corner line through the years this is a great athlete the trademark leiva s defense has always been dropped deep and,0
this container that s your middle linebacker that s basically 18 yards deep we go back to the live action 27 yard line 26 yard,0
line make it the game is down to just short from the 25 from out of one yard pickup now atkinson and john eliot tackle,0
until nelson comes to the sidelines to talk with us coach youre watching nfl monday night football with timeout our score the cleveland browns 14,0
and the new york jets separately the brand of sparkplug you use can make a difference in hillclimbing power and right here at road america,0
football great paul hornung an homerun champion roger maris are going to prove it theyll drive identical new chevy trucks there s just one important,0
difference hornung struck the white one has champions spark plug but maris s truck has a different brand mornings champion equip truck takes the lead,0
and holds it to win the hill climb now we switch the plugs and run the race again this time maris s truck the red,0
one gets the champions throttles are mechanically controlled so it marries his truck wins this time the reason has to be a difference in spark,0

other brands check it out for yourself champions can make a difference there are kelly has now carried the football 12 times but he is,0
picked up only 21 yards against the jets it is second down and nine for cleveland ball just outside the new york 25 both scott,0
and laroy kelly 35 and 44 their numbers respectively or the set backs behind bill nelson dickerson and damari the guards nelson screen pass to,0

stream and along with ralph aiken number 51 they read it perfectly youll name is watching from the sidelines we have a minute and 40,0
seconds to go in the first half rounds a leading 14 to 7 the losses all the way back to the 35 yard line where,0
itll be third down and 24 like that third though in 19 nelson to throw pressures on he gets his pass away it is caught,0
by taylor right about the 20yard line but that will be short of the first down early thomas the rookie cornerback made the play for,0
the jets in the secondary there s the young man that made the catch and we have another penalty flag back up field so let,0
s watch as the officials confer with new york looks like the call is against cleveland looks like a major penalty the browns are leading,0
14 to 7 getting to first quarter touchdowns the jet scored in the second quarter and we have offensive holding against cleveland which literally puts,0
them out of field goal range in old fair hookers receptions not going to count but he did do a fine job of coming back,0
didnt catch an under thrown ball doesnt roll primarily because nelson was hit just about the time he released the ball in fair hooker a,0
great name i pass theyre down in about 42 yards to go or the cleveland browns the ball is back at their 40 no notes,0
in lesson four deep ethos for gary collins comes back and rock steve 10m the routine was whipped throwing the players palin for the past,0
the short gary couldnt hold tamas only outside kenan is not playing the bumpandrun as much as he was youll see comments had him beat,0
a lot of long receptions are made just like this for a ball being under thrown and actually college should have caught that one it,0
was not a wellthrown ball cannon let him get behind him and he had his back turned to the quarterback and he was just trying,0
his best to keep up with it rock rock will hunt for cleveland on fourth down and 40 to mike battle and ed bell of,0
the deep men the jets good hanging fun and ed bell takes it at the 19 yard line on a bear catch where the jets,0

thinking to watch joe run these last two plays you know where i plan to do that i dont know why did it but it,0
seems to work real well a lot of times when a guy has one picked off he s a little hesitant to throw one again,0
i bet you throws one let s go 25 seconds to go on first down and 10 from their own 38 yard line namath fact,0
tonight ive got a shot at him but he gets it away just in time and the pass intended for emerson boozer is incomplete now,0
i got a good shot at anybody he hit him to joe namath when the new york jet quarterbacks were sacked only 16 times in,0
the entire season last year only daryle lamonica of the oakland raiders enjoyed greater success you dont see joe namath down too many times at,0
least sack too many times you see him down a lot but after the ball is gone second down and 10 new york from their,0

and throw the ball you have a tendency to get a little careless in the last part of a hand with a lot of part,0
of the ball game you want to go down the field so badly that sometimes you forget to read all your keys and certainly the,0
middle linebacker is a big key in the passing game and especially if you play against cleveland with ten seconds to play you have to,0
think that joe namath is thinking field goal right now get it close enough for jim turner who has great range a mammoth boring with,0
a bomb intended for don maynard the fast is going out of bounds but maynard never really had any hope of getting nothing because a,0
rich barnes had him on the ropes all the way killer but it also came over to cover maynard on a deep route again i,0

your outside receivers with two men whatever that s possible they can do it with a double zone or play start alone namath in the,0

ahead the jets are out statistically statistically but the brown dont make the mistakes the jets have that s the way the browns have won,0
so many times really is howard they rely on the other team making mistakes joe namath is the quarterback your shower is wide to the,0
left namath back to throw looks to the left goes over the middle intended for a mature mover down boozer was covered by houston and,0
my cow the gesture of day of hermon indicates to me the unhappiness of that young giant that the penalty again will go against the,0
jet as jim houston talking the referee norm stacker who incidentally is a high school principal in los angeles california jetts have now been penalized,0
142 yards the browns only 59 this is what you call making mistake and that major penalty of 15 yards moves the ball back to,0
the new york 10yard line where it will be first down and 25 rasmussen and herrmann of the guards schmidt the center penny and hill,0
of the tackles the tide in his feet lemons for new york namath will throw from the goal line he gets it away deep intended,0
for shower and some nerve chasing it cannot quite reach also back there depending on the and that pass was thrown right from the goal,0
on another penalty flag down incidentally back in the vicinity of where the fastest thrown namath threw the ball from the goal line 55 yards,0
in the air this time the penalty is against cleveland i think it s a roughing the passer penalty i believe gregory was a little,0
overzealous on that last play and it took a pretty good shot and our friends from beaver falls yeah that s a break for them,0
they have a first down but the plain fact is it was an unwise throw by to cleveland brown and its first down ten yards,0
to go for the jets back where they were a few moments ago at their own 25 it s 6:45 to play it s 49,0
to play in the third quarter that s maps now and while sumner number 29 who is that a fine ball game and the defensive,0
secondary at the cleveland making the tackle it s another first down for the new york jets as the ball goes just outside the fort,0
here pickup of 15 yards that s just a quick hitting what they call a zone block that s with winston hill blocking on gregory,0
and the lead back that last play was boozer blocking out on lindsey and snell just split the clean private tweener picked up a nice,0
game that s now picked up seven to nine yards and a dozen carries they get a new football here s john schmidt did not,0
like the feel of the one he had 2414 damnit throws a quick one zeus our and george s hit right at the 45 yard,0
line by walt sumner well played by sumner he caught it read and instantly was right in there on salwa gain of five yards second,0
down and five five minutes and 45 seconds now to play in the third quarter next monday night kansas city at baltimore two teams right,0
here battling it out tonight who should really figure in the total picture of the american football conference this year emerson blazer eirik barnes grabs,0
him the first man to get him and then he gets a little help from john garlington big number 72 jerry shirk he may be,0
a rookie but he s getting a full taste 24:14 to score the cleveland browns jumped into the lead 14 nothing first cordova jets got,0
their first touchdown in the second quarter make it 147 at halftime palma jones voted 94 yards with a second half kickoff make a 217,0
the jets came right back 2114 and then a 27yard field goal by don cut off makes it 24 14 the jets not trying to,0
move it again and a straight power play over the left side pulled a first down on third and one the ball is given him,0
at snell and he just muscled his way in for the first down the jets now have a total of 22 to 14 for cleveland,0
that jerry shirk is getting some kind of lesson done he really is i think leslie got one of that last play time remaining you,0
saw that s now on pushdown intent from the 46 yard line is down to about the 41 yard line for a pickup of 5,0
yards and he ran behind winston hill 3:45 to go in the third quarter the browns are leading by 10 the jets trying to close,0
it up that s now walter johnson s got it right about the line of scrimmage that will probably get about one yard itll be,0
third down in a long four yards for new york paul is just short of the cleveland 40 historian joe namath s worked so far,0
in the game he looks for lemon he throws to boozer closer is cut down by sumner with help from lindsay at the cleveland 32,0
yard line that s the new york first down big play for the jit they needed that first down very badly theyve got to at,0
least get a threepointer they need seven lots of time done theyre controlling the football that means cleveland cans for good point two minutes we,0
emerson boozer you just saw leave the field george knock number 37 has come into the ball game along with lee white number 34 we,0
have two new setbacks in the lineup for the jets now and boozer out namath will throw goes for the corner for maynard and it,0
is nowhere near just an observation keith i know that i dont think maynard is running as well as he can tonight he s miss,0
mowcher must most of the preseason game and with a calf muscle injury and he just doesnt seem to be the old swift maynard and,0
richard castro just come into the game back play so he s the big rookie from jackson state 65 222 pounds 21 years old and,0
when he gets his hands on the football you better look quick there s matt snell getting some refreshment it s a very hot muggy,0
night temperature game time was 79 degrees second down 10 new york at the cleveland 32 namath it was gregory who s got it but,0
that s the opportunism of this finely grilled cleveland team when the play most matters defensively they have the capacity to make it let s,0
take a look at how he does this youll notice as herman coming out to pick him up he gave an outside move it just,0
came inside that s competing for the door jill actually made a good move with his knees as weak as they are there was really,0
no way for him to get away from him so he protected his knees and went down to the counter the loss is all the,0
way back to the outside the 40 to make it the 43 yard line it is third down they have to go to the cleveland,0
22 to get the first down so it s third and for the jets naima pretreating they almost get him again he throws the pass,0
"complete and more than 85,000 partisan fans really rollin the fans are getting in he s used to it he can tell you about a",0
fella named big ben davidson from oakland who broke his jaw but again testimonies to the kind of an athlete the joe namath is he,0

to throw on third down and nine putting 21 fires penalty flag down he hits morin at holloman made the backhoe for the jets theyll,0
bring it back berlin big in the backfield and we may very well have a little too much roughness on a cleveland quarterback bill nelson,0
i think is actually a holding penalty youll see number 35 scott did when i was green actually they grabbed him by the leg number,0
85 there s the holding penalty rather than roughing the classic actually he did get a pretty good lick as blanton collier they coach of,0
the cleveland brown the ball is back now at the 7 yard line third down and 27 is nelson goes to the air hits leroy,0
kelly the marlins wish they had his hands on it you couldnt hold it for the jets that incomplete fast it slid right out of,0
kelly in the baker s hands and ralph couldnt hang on so itll be a kickin down coming up for the cleveland browns and now,0
here i think is something that worries a lot of people with the cleveland organization from president art modell right on down and particularly blanton,0
collier he has a fine punter in don khakhra but he is not too long cockroft will punt from in his endzone now the question,0
is field position right here four seconds to play third quarter id see where the jets get the ball back at the 42 ed bell,0
he is swamped on at the new york 48yard line but it s still good field position for the new york jets and we have,0

line for new york first down let s take another quick look at this isthese theyll come back in behind they must not say it,0
was inaudible but it possibly was a false step for the right they had a beautiful hole i think snails will upset that he didnt,0
score on that one first down and ten for the jets on the cleveland clinic emerson boozer over the left side he s got about,0
five the appalling up statistics if not points nell is gone 89 yards 16 and 10 four yards on the carry by emerson bougar they,0

position for the new york jets or as if boozer stayed in whose estate in leave white came in to replace matt snell walter johnson,0
number 71 gets credit for the last knuckle the ball nose of the ball touching the 25yard line make a third down and three theyve,0
gotta go just about the 22 will to get the first down hey there he s pushed to the first down bill and rude number,0
52 a fouryear man from southeastern louisiana in at a line back position right now both cleveland making his first occurrence of the ballgame in,0
a defensive posture and theyve got a measure for the first down just enough that s first down with one jets against 14 the browns,0
are leading however by 1024 14 block running 1250 to play in the game mr big rookie wide right that s enough number 37 now,0
in replacing boozer at the set back position he s inside the 20 maketh the 18th possibly saw the strong safety come on that last,0
play and become i mean the strong safety blitz aires emerson boozer on the bench looks like we might have a clamp where theyre rubbing,0
on it so tonight like this that s not uncommon second down make it seven yards to guard go to leave white and he cannot,0

hour day was jack gregory the big defensive end 250 pounder fouryear veteran from delta state who recovered the football so bill nelson will put,0
it in play 1st down and 10 from his own 7 yard line they are kelly whoa he really got popped by baker number 51,0
coming across the top and johnelliott number 80 on the bottom now the clock is ever running it s 11 minutes and seven seconds six,0
and so on down that yet must get possession quickly if were to have a tight ballgame down to the final wire there is plenty,0
of time if they can contain cleveland now 65 is john damari 66 is hickerson the guard the peco s our chef wrath and tafoni,0
the thai thinh is milt morin nelson leaflets he finds is it good yes city is cooked up at the 20yard line and that will,0
be a first down the man who made the catch is flat on his back well take a second look at it here s a,0
cup look at our licks gary collins took a heck of a lick in the back of his head and he s down and out,0
i think steve tena was also hurt on that last play colors has been and is their clutch receiver and that might show you a,0
reason why he catches the ball with a lot of folks around him he is a smart smart risky but he doesnt have to have,0
the speed that he had in 64 when he was the most valuable player in the title game won by the cleveland browns but there,0
s nobody smarter at running his pattern it s like another look at it that was awful awfully tough dick right there he got both,0
of them gary may have noticed in him and his approach route it when he left the line of scrimmage he began to weave a,0
little bit weaving by going inside and outside this is a very deceptive move for a defensive back to to recognize because from this position,0
and with that type of route he can go to the end flat on to the outside he has an excellent route that he runs,0
off of that down and then move that where hell plant his foot and come back to the outside well both those fellas all right,0
they seem to be done done you saw ten and just give collins the slight bump at the line of scrimmage on that one and,0
as a wookie he s got to learn if he s going to bump he s just a bump because you can play it that,0
way and let the potential receiver get by you that quickly it s been a lot of talk lately about the bump and run that,0
allows the defensive back as long as these in front of the potential receive are coequal with them to bump them push him or whatever,0
until he either turns his back to that line of scrimmage or until the quarterback releases the football pushed down cleveland browns ball at their,0
own 21 yards homer jones in replacing gary khan and we have some encroachment along the line of scrimmage following the news tonight we invite,0
you to join the dick cavett show with a special guest john cassavetes peter kaufman ben gazzara dick cavett show following the news tonight on,0
abc though the encroachment call against the new york the balls with the 25yard line notice still if you will dandy done as they still,0
capitalize on grounds opportunities how nelson gets the ball out of trouble when he had to take that was one of his biggest first downs,0
hell have all night was the one he he threw to gary collins i get the 26 yard line just outside the 25 pushed down,0
and five to go and i give it in the middle give it to the money man leroy kelly green search stack him up incidentally,0
that s the total of 250 yards in this ball game in total penalties for both team the jets with 148 of it they browns,0
need one yard for the first time theyve got to go to the 31 it s second down and one and the offensive interior line,0
remains the same temari and her christened the guards kelly sliding in behind dick chef graphic number 77 wedging for the first down and i,0
do believe he has it nine and a half minutes to go in the game it is the cleveland first step he s got it,0
but leroy kelly has in 17 carry has gone for only a grand total of 40 yards he has not been a compelling figures tonight,0
the browns are leading by 1024 14 oclock running nine minutes to go nelson still has it for milk horan wk hicks and now have,0
consumed their to swipe the past is incomplete so itll be second down in ten all the browns from there 32 that electrifying 94 yard,0
streak by homer jones with a kickoff to start the second half blooms very big in this ball game nelson still has a penalty flag,0
down swings it out to both scots the man who really made the way possible defensively for the new york jets is number 60 larry,0
grantham the loss is back around the 26 yard line both scott getting a very slowly and limping and will come off the field as,0
steve engel a rookie from colorado will go in to replace him and you see the illegal procedure indication against cleveland refused for the jets,0
and bo scott goes to the bench itll be third down and fourteen yards to go for the cleveland brown the ball is now back,0
at their own 27 eight minutes and 44 seconds to play in the game bill nelson gets his pass away tomorrow and he s got,0
it holloman and hicks make the taco but it s a first down for prepared clay yes a big play in a field night for,0
walt warren we told you at the very top of the game that one of the key matchups would be lauren again tonight for strong,0
safety whether that be jim hudson who unfortunately had to go out his knees just not right coming off knee surgery what gus holloman his,0
replacement lauren has been a dominant factor when most it counted in this contest the game 22 yards he is caught morin has caught five,0
passes for 89 yards in the game where they makes the point which i would just do for you paula zahn the 49 first down,0
leroy kelly whoa look out he is down at the new york 37 yard line maybe the 36 before steve thompson finally ran him down,0
that s the way to break it but kelly i remember when they used to do that with jimmy brown again and again and again,0
they do and this is what we view bank said you may stop kelly 15 times in a row at one time you might break,0
i think the brailles are doing two things here they theyre making a great drive but theyre also shoot up a lot of that clock,0
we should also note that both scott has returned to the offensive backfield he is a fine blocker romo jones is the wide receiver for,0
the left side berlin biggs may have jumped to pick two volvos theyre based on lookout inside the 20th of the nineteen that penalty flag,0
may have been thrown against the jets early thomas finally rustling big boast got down and scott really grew up in his football career in,0
canada let s take a look at this actually when diggs jumped offside you can see a slight hesitation on the jet defense kleavon continued,0
with their play there was a fine hole there that s a good move there by both scottie tried to move to the outside to,0
get a get around early thomas couldnt quite make it another big first down for cleveland the ball is right after the new york 19,0
yard line six minutes and 55 seconds to go in the away that s me walk away after 15 velen biggs 86 in early thomas,0
45 and there s blanton collier kelly now 19 carries 59 yards browns 10 3 and 1/2 the regular season last year see the time,0
ticking away new york jets for 10 and 4 in their respective conferences this year they are in the same country round to the central,0
division with the ameri get from the eastern division six penalty flags flying all over the place as both scott is dec back around the,0
20yard line ralph baker number 51 berlin biggs number 86 so we have really seen those penalty flags flying around tonight and nobody is leaving,0
"this big crowd of 85,000 all just sitting here watching it penalties against wheeler illegal procedure declining private jet six minutes three seconds to play",0
in the game next monday night on abc from baltimore maryland the baltimore colts and the kansas city chiefs and you very likely are going,0
to see johnny unitas past the quited mile mark in passing yardage gained in his brilliant football career bill nelson the pro he looks for,0
fair hooker and a penalty against steve kenan he got his feet tangled up with hooker down at the 7yard line i think itll be,0
very clear to you what happened here boy you just cant do things like this and expect it lady ball game you see fair hooker,0
run around a corner there s your buffett run he didnt have his hands on him the balls in the air looked as if he,0
may be stepped on his foot but that s still too much interference im not gonna try to get that interference call again this time,0
but that was an interference call john little another rookie from oklahoma state now in the defensive lineup for the new york jets number 57,0
ball is at the 7 yard line first and goal to go for cleveland that s both scott and just coming to the game makes,0
the big play back outside the 10 losses back to the 11th use him the browns take off another sweep little does like a fine,0
move as he loses blocker penetrates into the backfield stages if cleveland lost the guard somewhere along the way that possibly was supposed to block,0
just a little but he s freshman on a hot night that could mean quite a bit at this juncture 552 remaining in the game,0
second down and goal to go from the 11 cleveland s ball new york 11 nelson to throw he lives it for morons it s,0
too long double coverage that time on milk by holloman and hicks now you can say you bank works troubled teeth that this boy well,0
remember the old adage set forth many years ago by wallace wade at duke university and he says nobody ever really wins the football game,0
somebody loses it i think that s true in every form of sport third down and goal to go for the cleveland browns up new,0
york 11 yard line 24:14 the browns lead by 10 nelson the floor flips it over the middle it s incomplete and again from the,0
right side but elected to come back to his tight end milt morin number 89 nelson now 12 for 27 in his passing for 145,0
yards but he did his job and he did it beautifully he took over after the snell fumble on their own 7 yard line and,0
let the browns all the way downfield chewing up approximately 7 minutes in the process with 544 to go the field goal attempt on fourth,0

a 40 rookies who have won starting jobs on american football conference and national football conference teams this year at the final countdown last week,0
there as we told you at the outset tonight 181 rookies on the nfl rosters among the 40 starters nine were firstround breath choices and,0
six were chosen in the second round looking at veteran john elliott right there from texas many late round picks made it to like early,0
thomas who was the jets pick in the 11th round here is the puck now by don cochran he kicks it toward mike vettel he,0
comes up and how about that i dont think the new york jets will ever forget this game here if you will these statistics unofficially,0
the jet let s look at the play again an incredible break for the browns battle running as if he were back at the university,0
of southern california illadvisedly the ball is on the 4 yard line the jet cannot prove it to amplify what i was saying a moment,0
ago t unofficially the jets have gained 545 yards in this game totally the 219 for the cleveland brown yet with the clock running out,0
a minute and 20 to go im in 19 a minute 18 you see it they are trailing 24 to 21 they lost this game,0
themselves if theyve lost it is second down and 12 new york s ball at their three yard line tester is wide to the right,0
sauer wide to the left namath deep in the end zone to throw he throws it is big number 81 gregory i am sure almost,0
sure it was gregory got his hands on it kirk was there too an incredible break on the bounce of the punt that wound up,0
65 yards let s watch that good take a look at him maybe it goes back to said of course the flavor defenses it s,0
very deep the great move by gregory third down in 12 new york from their own three yard line 53 seconds to play in the,0
ballgame is their lightning let s see if he goes for sauer to the sidelines was right there but he literally i think gave him,0
the fact let s stop the clock that s nothing else they need to do let s take a look at what is recognized as,0
one of the very best pattern runners in football he drives well the best wrapped in football watch his feet stay inbound and that takes,0
a lot of time and a lot of work this is something that george sauer doesnt mind either one of them he puts a lot,0
of time in the game because he loves it first down new york at their own 18 yard line 47 seconds to play the browns,0
"lead 24 to 21 before more than 85,000 people schneider almost gets famous it is very festive my that was a great shot it was",0

in favor of the cleveland brown the new york jets were the winners statistically but the cleveland browns presented themselves the way they have so,0
many times in the history of don meredith as an opportunistic football team making the big play when most they had to make it actually,0
in terms of offensive plays the jets at 70 the browns 57 first downs the jets had 31 the brown said 20 yards total on,0
offense our earlier figure unofficial was wrong the jets 450 the browns 219 how did the browns do it their first two times around when,0
they had the ball in the first quarter nelson drove them to touch down the jets scored in the second quarter that made it 14,0
to 7 and then homa jones really broke it open at the start of the second half with a 96yard touchdown sprint the browns were,0
never behind they finally won 31 to one with a final score on an interception by billy andrews 31 to 21 the cleveland browns over,0

was rookie charlie waters number forty one who made the stop watch greg landry lily will put the pressure on but that s really what,0
landry wants now he is letting me pass rushes in you get soft blocking you saw 42 alka taylor just he didnt even try and,0
hit lily that s how you set up the screen and greg landry is really he s really gonna become a great but im sure,0
that because he does all things well lions with a third and six from their 24 walleston the intended receiver and he cant quite reach,0
it he atop distance her matter label once again landry got a big rush on him landry is now 2 out of 4 for 17,0
yards and the lines will have to punt in the hand is for the dallas defensive unit landry even did a good job on that,0

specifically likes to red dog theyd like to shoot their safety men on this you see tommy vaughn walking up theyre chitchatting with the linemen,0

it again maybe we can see working against lombardi number 21 haze the ball is thrown low well let you be the judge it s,0
very difficult i think i think it took a little bow fourth down six for dallas whitby in to punt barney is deep though his,0
tom vaughan 5:27 left to play in the first half of this defensive battle before the ball was sad so bring it back i cant,0
tell you what that might be other than too much time on the part of the cowboys illegal procedure is the indication we get fiveyard,0
penalty and move the ball back to the 32 yard line now fourth and eleventh party let s the bounce at the 5yard line he,0
s going to be in trouble deedee lewis number 50 was down there along with mark washington number 46 and it with me ever give,0

and didnt know it that s tommy vaughn of the lions who is limping rather badly as he left the field but the appears to,0
be in better shape right now back to live action detroit first and ten from its fiveyard line following that tremendous punch by ron would,0
be at dallas far out to the eighth pick up of three itll be second in 7:54 is halle 66 is and ray well that,0
was some kind of punch and to drop it on the five like he did they puts the lions with their back to the wall,0
now black moving with four minutes 45 seconds left to play in the first half second and seven detroit from its eight yard line paler,0
got a couple to the ten ran into lily number 74 said a third down lines will still need six for the first down dady,0
lewis checks into the defensive lineup for dallas replacing dave edwards at an outside linebacker probably an anticipation of the past dave edwards has been,0
taken up a couple times this year back down landry after the 12 yard line but you saw some movement on the right side of,0
the dallas defensive line jorge andrey andrey just crossed the line of scrimmage n and you are six six and 250 pounds is not really,0
a ballerina out there he just couldnt get back did not make contact but he just could not get back and of course is a,0
very big play for the lions who otherwise would have had a pun out of their endzone now they have a third down and need,0
just the yard for the first out from the 15 yard line once again two tight ends in there craig cotton number 87 has joined,0
charlie sanders number 88 third and one bar backed up at the line of scrimmage and i dont believe you man it see what they,0
measure his progress charlie waters number 41 along with her bad early moving up from the secondary to make a fine defensive play it s,0
going to be close enough for measurement shai the purse down by that much that much fourth down and id say greg landry looked over,0
the bench and his dallas fans are cheering their defensive unit as well they should stopping the very potent offensive detroit cowboy defense is now,0
working on its 18th successive quarter without yielding a touchdown renfro number 20 hayes number 22 at herrmann weaver standing on the goal line waiting,0
to punt nice kick nice kick renfro backpedaling at the 28 30 frank throw to the 35 drop bike break cotton number 87 at the,0
42 yard line renfroe just about turn that corner that was the first time the cowboys have set up to try and run back the,0
previous hunts they had tried to block 57 yards the weaver he really put the foot to it dallas leading three nothing three minutes left,0
to play in the first half the clock is moving rutger wide to the right side hey set inside of him garrison for the 46,0
yard line for a pickup of four mochi number 53 is over there lion defend theyre limping there you may notice is that jim mitchell,0
the rookie and from virginia state one thing you do when you set up an offense for a team that does a lot of study,0
is you set up just four or five running plays designed to go against any defense that way you dont force your quarterback to audible,0
eyes a lot i change to play at the line of scrimmage cowboys go with a double wing formation sideline throw intended for hayes martin,0
is now three out of 12 and he s not having his better day he missed reggie rucker earlier for a sinch touchdown he under,0
through the haze now twice cowboys now have a third and five ball is at their 47 yard line lay down where craig morton has,0
to have circulating in his mind what are they going to be in they could be in a zone could come with a put it,0
could be in their command once again from the double wing wow over the head of both rucker and hayes and dallas forced into a,0
punting situation well i could say he just was throwing it away but the man was wide open he just overthrew it we pause five,0
seconds for station identification youre looking at lombardi number 20 and tommy vaughan number 48 as ron would be if the cowboys prepared to punk,0
away barney at the 11:00 still on his feet finally dropped at the 16 yard line then barney he has total disregard for a very,0
little body you saw him earlier catch up right in front of a couple of big cowboys there s the twominute warning with the score,0
dallas three detroit nothing let s pause for a moment the only antipollution gasoline it makes sense to me one with no light at home,0
and amico is the only one that comes in to lead free dreams one for our big car and the new one for our little,0
car let s free amico id like to speak to mr johnson please please lost in the shuffle allstate is trying to make it all,0
a lot easier say youve got a burglary claim on allstate homeowner s insurance you just call allstate and get a claim specialist who s,0
always easy to reach allstate makes it all a lot easier youre in good hands with allstate greg morton of the cowboy is obviously not,0
happy with this throwing do a little extra warmup another practicing over there along with player coach daenerys handling the ball in defense of martin,0
he has two weeks ago suffered quite a severe cut on his passing hand but last week he was on target beautiful lions first intent,0
from their 15yard line steve owens number 36 as andrey makes the stop at the 18 which was market up to 19 a pickup of,0
3 itll be second in seven oclock moving with a minute 40 left to play in the first half both sides of all three of,0
their timeouts remaining welcome mccullough come wide to the left side landry stepping back getting walking for the first down at the 31 yard line,0
renfro number 20 making the stop you talk about your cornerback play cowboys with renfro and adderley and the lines with the lebeau and that,0
limb barney i guess you couldnt find two finer sets of quarterbacks they all that one characteristic of all corner box and theyre willing to,0
gamble at any time lions are going to utilize the first of their three a lot of timeouts here with a minute 19 left to,0
play in the half there s bobby hayes you know bobby s got some gloves on here at the silent well chilly down there in,0
the in the shade and of course the the entire playing field now is just about in the shade temperature in the low 50s will,0
breeze blowing that s another interesting comparison youre looking at bob hayes and for the detroit lions they have earl mcculloch both great track champions,0
both well under nine four for the hundred heys last sunday against houston caught four touchdown passes which was a club record there s mccullough,0
number 25 first and ted lyons moving from there 32 yard line trailing three nothing landry misfiring that time like somebody in his arm that,0
thing went off actually he looked down phil and he had earl mcculloch wide open in front of mel renfro but he saw leroy jordan,0
the middle linebacker coming over he was threw in the ground they say this fella is the fastest quarterback in the nfl and a rather,0
statistical oddity he owns the mark this year for the longest run from scrimmage he had a 76 yard quarterback sneak in the season opener,0
against green bay that stood up all year believe me thatll stand up for a long time second and 10 renfro good position by mel,0
renfro looked up just at the right time it was there to contest earl mcculloch we talked about track man mel renfro is also attract,0
man to university park let s take a look at speed on speed renfro 2025 is mcculloch good move im mccullough but renfro the veteran,0
using the sidelines he knew it was there he knew mcculloch couldnt catch it out of bounds so he was able to turn his back,0
and make up the distance right now greg landry has put himself into another passing situation as we see the dallas cowboys insert dede lewis,0
for the extra speed if the linebacker position replacing dave edward landry is three out of seven for 29 yards at the 35 stopped short,0
of the first down at the 38 yard line he didnt make it to the sidelines so the clock continues to roll along showing 50,0
seconds and once again a big hand for the dallas defensive unit im gonna quite surprised that dallas does not call time out the clock,0
continues to roll and you better believe detroit s going to take all the time they can before they pun it grant rowan hayes the,0
deep man locks still moving with 25 seconds left nice high kick oh he got off another beauty touchback well bring it out to the,0
20yard line and dallas will have 15 seconds to complete the first half s play well he kicked that ball 70 yards in the air,0
61 yards officially from the line of scrimmage for herman weaver he s got a 57yard in the 61 yarder there s bob lilley dave,0
edwards 52 and by not calling that timeout the cowboys now will take over first and 10 but they only have 15 seconds remaining on,0
the clock haze to the right side rucker to the left garrison to the 25yard line alex karras there again this watch number 71 he,0
gave yo veteran he takes on the block welcome new mom and that is the end of the first half with the score dallas three,0

business and they are so ncr wont have to learn your business first nor promise more than a computer can do someday your company will,0
talk to one of the most experienced computer companies you know because now you know ncr means computers both the detroit lions of the dallas,0
cowboys are back on the field for the start of the second half and a superb defensive battle it has been the detroit lions trail,0
with dallas cowboys three to nothing on a field goal by mike clark the game has been marked by three turnovers and here was one,0
of the first ones from orton throwing for dallas and the pass was intercepted after being deflected by mike weger who intercepted carried the ball,0
back to the dallas 44 and this was in the first quarter of the game detroit had some difficulty moving the ball charlie waters might,0
have been the defensive star of the first half for the dallas cowboys here detroit has the ball on the dallas 40 for the quarterback,0
here is greg landry who does fun larry phone garlin waters no reporting needs a rotation from clemson up and finally got through his own,0
45 yard line that led to the only floor the game our field goal by mike clark and charlie waters also figured in another one,0
when he recovered a fumble for dallas though it s three to nothing and now let s go back upstairs to frank lieber both the,0
cowboys and the lions ready to get the second half underway and he he thought this was a defensive battle boy he checked these did,0
these statistics here are frankly written they really really are low in terms of total yardage i think the big problem for the cowboys has,0
been craig morton he is not delivering the ball he is getting better protection the detroit lions are really not doing all this fan listening,0
that we anticipated theyre moving around a lot but they end up coming right back to their 4:3 there s craig morton he s had,0
"receivers open he hasnt reggie rucker wide open for a touchdown and im sure he is as unhappy as the 72,000 fans here at the",0
cotton bowl cliff harris on the left of your screen and mark washington on the right is earl mann prepares to kickoff for the lions,0
as we start the second half dallas leading three nothing there s a knuckler pounding at the 15 water s chasing it waters to the,0
20 and we get several penalty markers thrown as he is dropped at the 24 yard line and more than likely when you see a,0
flag on a kickoff team itll go against the team with the football they had so many off more opportunities such as clipping and the,0
discussion is the detroit lions by referee jim honey aw let s move back to the 12 yard line and the indication by honey is,0
clipping half the distance to the goal so donnell s to put the ball in play first and ten from its 12 yard line in,0
the first half the cowboys had a total of only 79 yards total offense the lions only at 93 13 in the first half pitching,0
to dewayne thomas thomas carries to the 14 yard line thomas rushed for 29 yards and eight carries in the first half garrison 32 yards,0
also an 8 carries the feeling detroit s going to be a different football team here in the second half theyre an emotional ballclub theyve,0
been playing on a motion for five weeks and well you can bet in that locker room that they were chitchatting with each other on,0
2nd and 8th thomas crossing the 15 to the 17 yard line as we thirddown dallas with still need about four for the first down,0
and the relay system continues tom landry now sending pettis norman as we look at the defensive call call by mike lucci the middle linebacker,0
number 53 morton has not completed a pass to a wide receiver he said garrison twice and norman once to account for his pre completion,0
thirtyfour from the seventeen once again excellent protection dorman was the intended receiver he was dogged over there by number 28 mike weger give you,0
an idea of the use of the tight ends for the cowboys number 84 and the other messenger 89 mike ditka they caught 17 passes,0
between them through the entire season ron would be to do the punting the average 44 yards on four kicks in the first half i,0

off this blocks vander and the 51 ability time s out that tackle perfectly still the first down for the cowboys i have an idea,0
theyre surprising the lions but there s no need to move the ball on the ground even though they not even come close to threatening,0

43 thomas to the 40 to the 35 man with a shot at him was number 48 tom dwan who saved the touchdown as dallas,0
picked up the first down at the 28 cowboys going to win this they should cut the ball up and give it to these guards,0
what play 961 hell be putting the blast on lynne barney and it s tough for a big man to block a little man downfield,0
look at him do it grain tom is playing it beautifully cowboys continue to run thomas now with a hundred 19 yards rushing in 23,0
carriers first down from the display 28 garrison inside the 25 down to the 22 wayne walker is back in the ballgame for the lion,0
number 28 wigger in good call by the quarterback tom landry sending in mike ditka thinking theyve been using the fit job that time they,0

the outside mouth made the tackle and again were going to be close enough for the measurement theyre free jim tony says bring it in,0
his drive started back at the 23 yard line and right now the way this game is going a touchdown would look awful big and,0
some kind of defensive battle nine minutes 51 seconds left to play in the ball game dallas for the 1st and 10 from the detroit,0
18 you can see what craig morton was doing during that time out dont forget tomorrow cbs bring to the other nfc playoff game san,0

carrots second and one from the nine yeah try to pick up the first down at the eight garrison now has seventy yards rushing in,0
16 carries cowboys of a hundred and ninety two yards on the ground again well keep reminding you this detroit lions theyre the number one,0
team national football conference against the rush and they are having the best part of their game broken down theyre down left to the yard,0
for the first down from the nine yard line eris number 71 along with doom off number 50 look at it again man there s,0
the center 61 again night of burying harris thomas squirming and twisting he always gets the extra two or three yards neighs to the left,0
side rutger to the right to give us the thomas he is to the three and itll be suck it in goal from that point,0
you know the way thomas has been going for the cowboys in the second half of the season there s really a forgotten man on,0
this dallas team that s calvin hill it was rookie of the year last year who is now healthy and just cant get back into,0
the lineup calvin hill has contributed his part though even hurt during the season he took to 577 yards and wayne thomas it was the,0
sixth time this season he s gone over a hundred yards rushing second and goal from the three thomas to the oneyard line itll be,0
third and goal from the one why does he use those guards dutifully 76 and john nylund the left guard watching paul now 76 now,0
watch thomas he s right on his tail blaine i cutting off the pursuit behind in a 61 look at his flock against bo breaking,0
it back to the inside martin will have garrison 32 thomas 33 behind him is running back on third and goal from the one mixed,0
up there in the cowboy beef an offensive backfield garrison football tries to fight over did he make it no indication yet and it does,0
not appear that he did make and what a decision head coach tom landry is that is going to have to make in the sidelines,0
lily kick the field goal do we go for the touchdown and even though we dont make it look at that again twentyeight moochie the,0
great football player my butchie is and therell be no field goal attempt bob hayes came off the bench run on fourth down and about,0
a foot the cowboys are going for the touchdown thomas did not the lions hold at the oneyard line and what a big play that,0
may turn out to be i think it was new mob number 50 who maybe key stop mister goes down number 83 wigger there number,0
28 but i think new mosfet shops with the score dallas read it twice nothing let s pause for a moment is the only place,0
i know of where you get a second chance in life the international dateline cross it and you get to spend yesterday all over again,0
that s worth celebrating with all the gusts though you can grab even in the beer you drink why settle for less when youre a,0
lot of springtime natural menthol not the artificial kind that s why salem safe springtime soft springtime fresh it s only natural dead goats tom,0
landry of the cowboys he is not happy at all as this team gives up the football on the 2 yard line to strike first,0
and thin a little over six minutes left to play in the ballgame alcee tailor to the line of scrimmage and no more he was,0
stacked up by larry cole number 63 second and ten from the two i think what tom landy was upset about there s not so,0
much missing the touchdown there was the foul up on that fourth down play and he was trying to find out what the world happened,0
there s it tom lad his counterpart joe schmidt across the way were getting down to the short strokes of this one chuck hughes replaces,0
walton at a wide receiver for the lions second antenna maybe a yard it s most from elf are again coal in there along with,0
lilly in leroy jordan is pregnant with the 38yard that his team is winning the football game with a little over five minutes to go,0
i know what kind of a call you come up with here you have a certain nine situation youre going to have to throw from,0
your endzone if youre gonna pass you can anticipate tremendous pat s rush this one came from the bench landry a safety landry is pressed,0
in the end zone for a safety and dallas lead five to nothing now let s pick up the first one for you from ground,0
level bob lilley moving to the inside just real cool 75 they crisscross coming from the outside george andre he misses the depo few pinches,0
it two points and what a big two points they are and of course the lions now with a freekick will have to give up,0
the ball again with 445 left to play bonus altogether fitting and proper i thank the defensive team gets the point with the score dallas,0
five detroit nothing let s pause for a moment now there s the isert in american regular and let s free abaco gasoline moisture from,0

and bob hayes awaiting the free kick by herman weber of the lions following the safety as landry was trapped for the third time this,0
afternoon i guess youd have to say now chances are pretty good we wont have sudden death with the score 5 nothing and the big,0
job of course pretty try it is going to be to stop that running game dallas being able to very high kick pays at the,0
30yard line 3540 bob hayes to the 44 hear that conversation already in the huddle it s called hang onto the football because the lions,0

211 left to play they talked about a lot about linebackers today but chuck hali was not fooled by that play at all 12 years,0
on the league he just waited in his area and he was about the only cowboy around it could have made the play when i,0
thought to bring bill monson the end of the football game mccullough to the right side walton to the left second and four from the,0
26 bar dave edwards parnell greene making who stopped at the line of scrimmage weve got a timeout call here well no it s official,0
timeout the clock will now roll to the twominute warning which comes up right now that of course was the reasoning for that call bill,0
munson knew that he would have the clock stopped for him with the twominute warning so he was not afraid to try and pick up,0
the first down running in addition to tomorrow s nfc playoff game cbs will bring you to other nfl postseason games next sunday january 3rd,0
the two winners of this weekend s playoffs meet for the national football conference championship and then on sunday january 24th cbs 2 bring you,0
the afc nfc pro bowl game from los angeles at 3:30 eastern time the lions are going to try to score a touchdown and win,0
this football game against a team that has not yielded a touchdown in its last 19 quarters and 13 minutes and their immediate problem as,0
munson comes back from his conference with head coach joe schmidt is the first down they have two downs to pick up three downs because,0
at this point in the game but what s down doesnt mean anything deedee lewis number 15 moves into the cowboy linebacking corps replacing dave,0
edwards as we head back to play lions have a third and three from their 27 yard line thrilling five to nothing mike clark was,0
a 26yard field goal in the first quarter and the safety you saw a few moments ago providing all the scoring munson dumps it out,0
the lt taylor at the 32 yard line he s got the first down but did not get out of bounds till the clock keeps,0
moving and detroit with three timeouts remaining go back into the huddle surprisingly they did not call to play in their huddle they continued to,0
use time the fox is running at 1:30 hughes is wide to the light side marsten sansa quite firm it s 32 massimo mccullough he,0
couldnt hold it covered by mel renfro and he had rent kofi and had he hold on to that football no matter whether he came,0
down inbounds or not it would have been complete because you do not have to come down inbounds with two feet if you have a,0
defender in contact with you there s the time remaining one minute and 20 seconds to a second and ten greg landry watching from the,0
sidelines now on the winning moment to this ballgame well i know that must make him sick well what a fine performer he s been,0
for that s five games 61 percent completion he s 5 out of 12 today for 48 yards second and 10 lions from their 32,0
with a minute 20 left munson his he threw the football pass was intended for charlie sanders the fine tight end of the detroit lions,0
who by the way has not caught a ball this afternoon when he had to get rid of that football let s take a look,0
at it again he had time to throw the ball and two and a half seconds at least the receivers recovered now watch jeff throw,0
a few number 75 flyaways munson about a 10 and a half leveling it is third and tenth for detroit lions still with three timeouts,0
remaining from their 32 once again face but the prospects of picking up a first down the good protection farah was cutting across the middle,0
the pass was over his head it will be fourth and ten for the lines from their 32 and it has come down to this,0
for detroit it could be the final play for the detroit lions this season and as bill months and times is the situation it s,0
a grim one id like to say what a fine job the dose mit has done with the football team in a road just for,0
an outside chance of getting out of the playoffs came up with the five in a row munson one out of four since he s,0
come into the ballgame spending paler in motion fourth down this is this colo made to catch this the 29 yard line first down for,0
the lions wow when a clutch kissed by earl mcculloch he s at the top of your screen he s covered by mel renfro doubles,0
covered as a matter of fact as cornell green also comes over to help cover somehow rather between the two defenders he comes down with,0
the football the lion would use a timeout the first of their three allotted timeouts they have two remaining as they now have moved to,0
the 29yard line of dallas and i believe that s detroit s deepest penetration for the afternoon they have done nothing offensively they have played,0
a whale of a defensive game keeping dallas and scoring a touchdown but they still trail by five 59 seconds remain they have two timeouts,0
remaining youd have to almost speculate the munson will you thinking now working to his outside receivers charlie sanders who led them in receptions the,0
40 on the season gets been getting double coverage all day long inside out for the safety man in the corner back bar has come,0
back into the lineup he s also a fine receiver boilesen butterflies governor amundson stomachs out there now lapel on to the left side walton,0
to the right first and then from the 29 of dallas for mccullough he was out of bounds renfro was over there covering 53 seconds,0
left to play in the game earl mccullough gave it the old try there s the time remaining dallas leading five nothing tom landry what,0
do you suppose is going on in that mine and this mine mr joe smith landy who has brought the cowboys is five times through,0
the playoffs dude great games against green bay 66 and 67 then beaten by the cleveland browns two following years all boiled down to this,0
second and ten from the dallas 29:53 seconds left once that criminal gets it away alcee taylor was the intended receiver but munson really got,0
the rice and had unloaded before he wanted to again jet through a few george andre larry cole and had he had just a fraction,0
more time he could have got that ball to taylor now i get the little help from the bench chuck hughes number 85 replaces chuck,0
walton her brother larry walton at the wide receiver for detroit 47 seconds third and ten from the dallas twenty nine used to the right,0
side mccullough to the left railroad role little 15 yard line swipe it down on the field right now look at it again huntsman on,0
a third and 10 firing hard to mcculloch who one hands it the ball goes in the air and mel renfro one hands it but,0
he holds on to it charlie waters was taken up on that play number 41 leading the field five seconds left and it was out,0
there that the dallas cowboys in the nfc championship game for the third time in five years greg morton the quarterback completed just for out,0
of 18 passes for 38 yards and a ball game thanks that have to maybe gives the game ball to the quarterback tom landry and,0

that s what the dallas cowboys are going to be in it just looking to hang on to the football now the lions have two,0

fans counting off the final seconds an amazing comeback by the dallas cowboys who were two games out of first place in their division with,0
only four games left to play in the regular season and now the great dallas defense which is now gone 20 quarters five full football,0
games without giving up a touchdown allisyn fact is yielded just 15 points and one touchdown in the last five games in the one touchdown,0

for 38 yards landry had 5 out of 12 for 48 munson s 2 out of 8 for 54 and the lions leading rusher was,0
mel far with 13 carries for 32 yards so that s the story now we take you to dick stockton in cbs control for pro,0
football report thank you frank lieber and a superb football game it was five to nothing a couple of weeks ago the dallas cowboys won,0
in another baseball score type game six to two over the cleveland browns they won in the mud and cleveland they had to win that,0
one they had to win their last game of the season against houston this has been the story of the dallas cowboys of 1970 and,0
one of the team s the lions or the cowboys had to win that sixminute day it was dallas in a thrilling game three to,0
nothing going into the final period and of course the cowboys that gambled they didnt make it but of course they trapped gregg landry in,0
the end zone for a safety to make it five to nothing bill munson took over for the lions and drove the team down earl,0
mcculloch made an exceptionally clutch catch deep in the dallas territory was probably the deepest penetration of the day for the lions to about the,0
29 yard line but the key play that ended it all was in the interception at the end and it was more than just the,0
interception here is bill munson going back to throw it s deflected off of the arm of earl mcculloch and intercepted by mel renfro number,0
20 after this play was over earl mccullough took off his helmet and he threw it hard to the artificial turf despair for the detroit,0
lions who was that kind of a game we have a roomful of dallas cowboys we have bob lilley we have henry jordan we unchecked,0
that leroy jordan we have the quarterback craig morton we have dwayne thomas who gained over a hundred and thirty yards today and of course,0
the winning head coach tom landry of the dallas cowboys plus videotape highlights so well be back in just a moment as the nfl today,0
continues with pro football report firestone raised white letter tires for your kind of car your kind of driving at your firestone dealer s higher,0
performance center firestone the mileage specialist when you work up a big thirst you can have a drink or you can have gatorade thirst quencher,0
that professional thirst quencher other drinks wet down the thirst gatorade quenches it gatorade is different than juices or fruit drinks or soda bottle water,0
research men created it thousands of athletes swear by it gatorade thirst quencher the professional thirst quencher tom landry the winning coach you must be,0
out of breath and you must be excited congratulations on like winning this very important game let me ask you youve been in so many,0
important contests in your career as a player and it s assistant coach and as a head coach how do you rate this game with,0
them that s the greatest win that weve ever had a dallas cowboys i dont think there s any question about it because it was,0
kind of a game of the shame either club had to lose because they came from so far back you know to get into this,0
playoff but were so happy that it was us of course that won this thing and it was a great tribute to the fellows because,0
they played superb ball in these last five games and they were never better than they were today tom your team has not given up,0
a touchdown in some twenty quarters now which is probably the greatest testimonial to an excellent defense today once again you stopped the detroit lions,0
and especially you stopped their running attack what must you say about this defensive club of yours well when the season started this year i,0
felt like this is the best defensive club weve ever had here we didnt play it well early but in the last four or five,0
games theyve started to play together very well and they just gelled in there theyve doing a fantastic job and you have to credit the,0
defense to win today it s a great team effort but i think their safety down there when we try to gamble and loss was,0
really a big play let me ask you about that it s been said many times that you dont give up the point if you,0
can get them and at that point had you made good on a field goal you would have had a six to nothing lead and,0
only a touchdown would have beaten you as it turned out of course the gamble didnt work and it paid off anyway because you trapped,0
landry for a safety but why did you decide to go for the points under the circumstance and give up three and and take the,0
risk of having detroit perhaps tie the score with a field goal and send it into sudden death well it s not my nature to,0
do this as you probably would be aware of i dont listen the fans too much but i do listen the players and i just,0
felt the players wanting to go for it so badly that i just couldnt deny them the chance do it where their key plays one,0
or two or maybe just one that you can recall that told you that your club was going to go down to the end battle,0
to the end of this contest and it was gonna be the kind of game that was well in a game like this you really,0
cant pick out any key play it would tell you which way it s gonna go because the momentum can change so quickly when you,0
got two good teams working there and and i really couldnt pick out names one thing i knew when we ran the ball so well,0
you know in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter there i knew that our chances were very good to win at that time,0
was this not a day for passing well it was a day for passing we werent really too successful throwing the ball and neither was,0
detroit but i think it was more to the excellent defenses that were working out there than anything else i think a lot of time,0
the news media you know buildup and glorified teams you won five in a row to get here and now youve won six in a,0
row what what happened so where do you draw the line where does the team cross the line where they decide that theyre not going,0
to give up and play out the season where do they decide that they are going to come back and battle despite the adversity well,0
i would pinpoint that point as a st louis game we got beat 38 to nothing that s the point you cant get much lower,0
in this and this is a time we turned it around the time our players started to say well were going to do anything we,0
better do it now and they did amazing finally coach i have to ask you this after the heartbreaking defeats to the green bay packers,0
and of course the losses to the cleveland browns do you think now that the club is over those psyche problems that the press has,0
kept on harping on throughout the past couple of years well i think were over i dont think this team will ever have any trouble,0
like that again i think there was too much made out of it we were beaten by very good football team in the green bay,0
packers and it just seemed like everybody talked about enough so we finally got psyched out ourselves and we couldnt play football anymore but this,0
is all behind us right now and you wont see the club do this anymore any preference on who youd like to play in the,0
nfc championship game not really there are two excellent football teams and theyre gonna have a whale of battle and be at home as a,0
minnesota boy yes that would be good but well be out in san francisco i guess the san cisco win tom landry once again congratulations,0
on a very big win today very much appreciate tom landry the head coach of the dallas cowboys winners today five to nothing and well,0
be back with more of the dallas cowboy players frank gifford and videotape highlights in just a moment well that s me a couple of,0
great football players on my ride bob low 74 youve been watching for a long time now bob and leroy jordan the i guess the,0
defensive captain and play caller and just going back into this football game ill ask you first bob that you heard your head coach sales,0
may be the most important game the cowboys of everyone did you feel that way so well of course i definitely did and you know,0
weve been through so much in the last four years and especially the last two years with the cleveland playoffs that this was an extremely,0
important game as far as i was concerned and i know it was as far as my teammates were concerned so we feel that we,0
finally her of age and were ready to battle anybody i believe i know you talked about those this of course the fist time the,0
cowboys made those playoffs maybe leave ill address it to you because so many people have as you well know wrap the cowboys over the,0
years they say they dont win the big games ive been around you guys long enough to know that that s not the case maybe,0
the circumstances something but it has to start to impact your ballclub a little bit me right yes i think it does i think the,0
thing that people didnt realize we had some problems that they didnt know about we had people injured and that s been the case for,0
the last three or four years finally this year we came in to the end of the season with people well and that s been,0
the case with our team we had people hurt early in the season but we got well at the end of the season that s,0
been the whole thing with this team this year weve been getting better every week there are you not the biggest of linebackers what 215,0
pounds neither chuck holly or dave edwards but you got these big cats up front that how about that line backing core i just wanted,0
to find this ive seen they you dont do a lot of listening either no we dont i think you have to have larger linebackers,0
and we are to blitz a great deal because most people block their backs and youve got to be able to run over them in,0
something which most the backs are bigger than we are so we dont try to do it too much we go back to defend we,0
have quick linebackers in dave edwards and chuck holley and so and so we feel like we can do a better job in the secondary,0
than we can blitzing and when you get the kind of rush we do you dont need the blitz that much and bob working alongside,0
of some pretty good boys yourself im thinking of course larry cole george andre and jethro pugh you had cost me they lured walton i,0
believe did they do anything that you didnt expect him to this and all they did about what we expected i thought larry was a,0
very fine guard when i watched him in offense and he sure enough was and i had a lot of trouble with him but thank,0
goodness we we all get the pretty good rush most of the time any preference bothers you i know youll be watching that game tomorrow,0
between minnesota in san francisco any preference as to the outcome of that one well you know we think an awful lot of dick nolan,0
but on the other hand would be planning so it doesnt really matter were just real happy to be right where we are how about,0
you leroy of course dick nolan bob billy was referring to as the defensive coach you understand i defer,0
defensive coach you understand i defer,0
from memorial stadium in baltimore maryland national football section featuring the 1970 super bowl champions kansas city chiefs and the baltimore colts threetime champions of,0
the national football league nfl monday night football is brought to you by ford and your ford dealer who invite you to come in and,0

country on the field here at memorial stadium quarterback of the baltimore colts johnny unitas water back to the kansas city chiefs len dawson with,0
them howard cosell leonard question number one i know it s early in the season but you did lose to minnesota you must regard this,0
as a mustwin game howard youre right even though it is early in the season it is a must game because we have yet to,0
get on the wind side and this is an outstanding football team were playing and im sure it s me great ballgame inevitably when a,0
team wins the title everybody shoots at them inevitably they say the hunger is gone as some of the spark left your club i dont,0
think so of course in a few minutes were gonna find out but i think weve got it there we have a piece things together,0
but hopefully ill come tonight good luck to you and thank you very much for joining it lenny dawson and now to the man who,0
s been proclaimed the quarterback of the decade and perhaps in the minds of many the greatest ever to play number 19 john unitas john,0
yesterday had practiced the left knee swabs and bandages and quite frankly a hyperextension that almost activated jim ward today and the thought that morrow,0
would start tell us first what is hyperextension well it s actually how are the knee being forced in the wrong direction instead of on,0
a hinge joint than the hinge works one way and they try to make it work both way all right you have to set by,0
pushing off the left foot in order to throw the pack will you be hindered tonight i dont think so the knee feels real well,0
today the swelling is going down and i have just a butt full amount of flexion in it and it s the biggest problem be,0
as i stretch out to try to get back a little bit faster that just wont permit me to get back there some of the,0
wouldbe experts have said you throw the short one with all of the old brilliance but the ability to throw the long one is no,0
longer there true or not true well you have to ask the expert final question they say that the 70s will be the decade of,0
the sprint out quarterback youre coming i dont think so howard is valuable the quarterback is i think they want him to stay back in,0
the pocket where he has the most protection occasionally he s going to get hit and they gonna blitz occasionally he has to have the,0
ability to move or slide from one side to the other and knowing where his protection is on his printout he s he s left,0
only one way to go and that s basically the way he s sprinting out too and it makes the coverage in the pickup superb,0
defensive team you face tonight but youre at best i can figure good lucky again thank you very much john unitas and now very quickly,0
let s meet our playbyplay announcer from whom youve already heard keith jackson and keith i would think youd like to point up some of,0

players in all of football tonight certainly a house full of allpro you talk about kansas city defense you think buchanan you think you think,0
the linebacking four headed by willa lanier you think aaron brown plus the sharp defensive secondary and of course baltimore s defense is led by,0
the great bubba bubba smith also the veteran fred miller and also one of the very fine defensive zone secondaries in all of football these,0
quarterbacks i think will be tested tonight all right now to our other colleague loose and easy with the magnificence of a texas drawl and,0
a background in professional football that in its time will be legendary dandy don meredith and dandy don you know how great these two teams,0
are defensively how will the respective quarterbacks attack them in talking to both lenny and john before the game it seemed that there was one,0
word that they kept using well have to be patient i know dawson feels that he must have stabbed running game first and that s,0
quite true he thinks at the baltimore zone can be beaten theyve got to be satisfied with the short passes as far as you know,0
i was concerned he almost said the same thing he said they have an odd stack defense it s very difficult to run against and,0
ive got to take the short one you know the good lord takes care of those who wait so well just find out tonight okay,0
dandy the pregame activities are just about over here at baltimore memorial stadium well be back with the opening kickoff in just one moment the,0

short side again i think it was a missed assignment because six was standing there kind of looking back at the quarterback and it just,0
ran right by him logan almost made the play with a good throw and kansas city is now in front seven to zip let s,0
see what johnny unitas can do about it first down 10 baltimore at their 20 that s dorm goulash football baltimore recover goolosh hit hard,0
jerry hill who is in the ball game replacing the injured tom madi and in the ball game primarily two blocks for johnny unitas fell,0
on the ball aaron brown was the man who listed goulash and knocked him loose second down and about 11 for baltimore from there 19,0
unitas it passes away the intended receiver fell down it s intercepted by johnny robin back up to 35 in robertson is roughed up to,0
24 roy jefferson the intended receiver sell anyway right into the hands of robinson well take another look take a look at it i think,0
you didnt fall down the path just a little bit a little bit high you can see marcellus definitely a good news to get inside,0
he did fall down take the pencil bit a little bit high anyway in robertson in the free safety position but he s recognizes the,0
best that there is especially the american football conference he s picked them off like jets for about 10 years johnny brought it back 14,0
yards call at the 25yard line it s just inside the 25 lenny dawson is the quarterback with hayes and garrett behind him and it,0
s mike dunn flipping and getting to the line of scrimmage that s johnny robinson on the bench says the scenery around that the free,0
safety who has to be a helpmate to the cornerback has to be swift and of course it s good if he is swift but,0
robinson an advanced veteran belies that theorem above all what a free safety must have is knowledge ability quick diagnosis of the opponent s offense,0
and position second down call it mine give mike garrett one yard on the last play richardson wide to the right garrett who too the,0
campus could in fact feel the penalty flags all over the field gain on the play about a yard billy ray smith leading the tacklers,0
for baltimore this month might not be necessary the time to mention this but dawson miss missed me earlier he said baltimore has me with,0
the most difficult stadiums to play in because of the crowd noise and i dont know what that was what drew jared off we may,0
not have heard this they know but here s a stadium that has been recognized to the league is one of the most difficult stadium,0
to play in the car the crowd noise and dawson says they have consists their number of auto before this game because of that very,0
reason and there has not been an empty seat here in this video for a cold football game since 1963 the coach accepted the penalty,0
make it second down and 14 for kansas city dawson has it before hilton after him the pass is incomplete the pass intended for wendell,0
hayes one of the backs coming out of the backfield heavy pressure that have from number 74 another gifted veteran billy ray smith ive never,0
played against smith and ill tell you it they can say what you worked it but you cant scare quarterback you look at billy ray,0
across that land and he s mad and he s mean and he s blowing we played up here in once i was real cold,0
i hated everything can you sit there any fries in earnest boat comes out of his mouth and i said billy right billy ray he,0
s a good football player set it down in fort p for kansas city the ball is at the baltimore 29 yards dawson still mezes,0
he swings us to war in mcveigh who was sent into the ball game at a running back position and mcrae is down at the,0
baltimore 22 yard line it was fred miller number 76 and jerry logan who made the tackle for baltimore and that of course brings into,0
the lineup and onto the field number three john spinner rude of kansas city now the ball is at the 21 yard line and from,0
that point this the spinner route is deadly his history shows that he is most successful from that distance 17 out of 21 outside the,0
20 yard line it is history and this one is through the uprights and so the kansas city chiefs bill the lead on a cool,0
night in baltimore maryland the kansas city chiefs 10 the baltimore colts nothing nice shot ive a better wanna play i came to play wisconsin,0
skinny that s me what s your game skittle fall salesman hey what do you sell skittle fall skittle full by aurora it s a,0
lot of fun jim duncan number 35 gardein number 30 deep for baltimore kansas city with 9 minutes and 16 seconds to play in the,0
first quarter leading 10 to nothing on this man 28 yard field goal and hell kick it off the chiefs getting the jump in the,0
first quarter he hits it deep into the corners at something this time duncan will come out with it he comes well he is beyond,0
the 25 baltimore s ball first in town after long 27 in the doctor ordinarily wouldnt be a good move to run a kickoff back,0
from that deep in the end zone but you know kansas city looked as if theyre so used to saying sinner who took him so,0
deep folks dont let them back to off it and i think they cut a hotel dup little bit about 2:30 duggan brought it back,0
duncan brought it back 33 yards remains at quarterback goulash and hell set behind it it s goulash flips just got him close him down,0
and then comes crown then comes one ear then comes bail and very made that pretty well covers him up loved it back to the,0
24 yard line second down and 13 goulash has lost six yards in three carry he with the top draft choice for the folks at,0
unitas goes to throw as time he goes over the middle of the pass intended for tight end john mackey is in robinson or emotionally,0
as howard cosell pointed out in conversation with johnny unitas at the beginning tonight story around has been the johnny does not have as much,0
on the ball especially the pass outside 25 30 yards but i wouldnt want to bet a nickel on the center is bill curry georgia,0
tech hippy and jefferson wide receivers both spread to the right side as unitas goes to flow and he s going down the sideline for,0
jefferson boys got it that was right on the money actually they were up on both of them pretty close youll see thomas with jefferson,0
you notice close of all just as he comes out of his break boys jefferson brady seven makes a great move thomas almost tipped it,0
away perfect throw nice move good catch go to the next play 17yard pickup on the play first down baltimore at their own 42 cave,0
so leading tender nothing in the first quarter 759 to play and bhulok they big rookie running back gary s to the 45 early to,0
open the box buchanan makes the tackle thanks traveler walk 15 miles probably before this game is over he s got two maybe three yards,0
before he runs into jim kearney coming over the top and curley cope on the bottom with jerry made big boo they call him keith,0
the number one draft choice for the colts from tcu funny story came up with his agent to negotiate the gun cost him in the,0
colts general manager the agent said don this dogs ready to hook he patted klosterman on the knee and ill finish the story after the,0
flight though was at the 48 third down they need three unitas will throw it he blows tabouleh he is hit by lynch but not,0
before the big kid from texas picks up the first down and just to finish the story wasserman made his offer and the agent what,0
s it done no longer patted him on the knee and said don this dog aint on a hunt but they reconciled the advances to,0
the 46 yard line kansas city territory the first penetration of kansas city country by the coat so far in the game we have six,0
22 play first quarter chief lead 10 nothing an agent could have been eight martin yet coach d talk like that unitas oh he gives,0
it off on the delay up the middle goes blue on he weighs 200 in like 220 and he hit hard he s got muscles,0
on muscles his problem has been a whole series of nagging injuries throughout his into collegiate career in his very first couple of days in,0
training camps that jerry pulled a hamstring but he appears to be fine now he was brought down by shirley cope and aaron brown on,0
that play he picked up three yards how about muscles or muscles youre not sure hate to see you quit maris and i said boy,0
i thought he was gonna say you know something night he said youve only got a league that skinnier legs whatd i do that s,0
true too ya know second down seven ball is at the kansas city 43 unitas under pressure gets his pass away a beautiful flipped my,0
fella take another look at this one jefferson s running a good pattern this appears to be a takeoff for a fly rod you can,0
see you had a set and throw unit he looks back wow he got one riding a note from marcellus it came back the ball,0
was a little bit low but it s close enough made a good catch first down from baltimore and don i think you want to,0
point out that that bump between the two was perfectly legal yeah that s right it s a baltimore first down at the kansas city,0
32 yard line the colts are moving who la will allah near has him from the back he s run to that right side i,0
was fit interested too ive been watching this he s run right at but kevin and brown that s the first time he s going,0
to the right side over there you never can tell what their game plan is a lot of times they got to go with their,0
bigger man but kenan and brown have been noted to be a little more difficult to run against at that time he went to the,0
right though funded jerry mays an early call second down and eight for baltimore right here the kansas city s 30 denied us a little,0
quick top over the middle just got lucky the big tide hold this way down to be a first down a very close to it,0
what about the 21 maybe inside the 22 but it s right down in first town territory co unitas does that so well it looks,0
as if it might be a play that was called in the huddle but actually he read the middle linebacker linebacker blitzing up the middle,0
and when he s gone you can see becky came right where he was and automatically he drove out of the center to the neck,0
and what a play on mac he is a lot of thing you know he s been rated the best tight end ever to play,0
the game but he has been behind in his training it was all involved leading the nfl players association in that pensioner national and a,0
lot of people was so quick to say that maybe mackey isnt so great as once he was but i suspect watching him tonight youll,0
say he is john mackey as we won and he s out of the game for a breather right now as tom mitchell comes in,0
at tied in and the handoff goes to the pitcher goulash and thick food jams it in for the first down as he goes to,0
the 18 you know tom mitchell was supposed to be hurt hobbling around on an ankle all week but here he is full of exuberance,0
into the ball game as they went through the two tight ends for the power play up the middle they always put in the two,0
tight ends when theyre inside the 20 ton mccafferty the coach of the baltimore coast market on the 17 yard line baltimore s ball first,0
down hill and goulash remain the set back bumpers from wyoming gets it and he takes it to the 14 yard line tinnitus is doing,0
exactly what he wanted to do dandy done establish the ground game thatll make this passing game doubly effective obvious drives a lot more effective,0
than their first two attempts seems like they were a little hesitant there theyre running in there blocking in the bill you know kansas city,0
has a way of doing that to the people they play their call you the biggest people in in football the clock did you see,0
the time remaining and baltimore comes up second down and seven at the 14 yard line kansas city s 14 the folks are on the,0
move unitas the throw bobby bell blitzing got it hard what a player that bell is he s been talked about so many times and,0
it s been said so often he could play any position and be a star one of the extraordinary athletes of our time back outside,0
the 22 yard line i remember him at minnesota howard he was some kind of ferocious when he played college football dominate let s take,0
a look at it right quick balint comes up in bluffs blit but theyre really what anybody there blocking and that does hurt third down,0
and 15 for the baltimore folks and baltimore now takes too much time and they will lose five more that s too bad that s,0
kind of unusual this telecast presented by authority of the baltimore colts football club intended to the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or,0
other use of the telecast without the express written consent of the baltimore colts football club and the national football league is prohibitive third down,0
and 20 baltimore ball is back at the 27 unitas to throw looking for jefferson it was considered a fumble and kansas city comes up,0
for the football that s exactly right the official adjudged that the arm was not moving forward in which case it would have been a,0
judge to be a forward pass incomplete since it was not moving forward it was the bumble and ruled accordingly and kansas city has the,0
football first in family at their own 26yard line look at jeff jim marcellus was injured on that last play i saw him limp off,0

middle of robinson who was just plated roberson plays the quarterback as well as he can and i cant emphasize how well he does play,0
it i dont think john saw him did john followed the receiver all the way through and robbins was playing the free safety position again,0

line total act returned that punt 24 yards mcveigh and wendel haze of a setback our vanus off the power high the tight end moving,0
into his normal position the handoff to mcveigh up the middle both coming from the secondary to make the tackle and he moved the ball,0
to the baltimore 42 yard line what a great trade hank stram made to get a little warren mcveigh out of houston he had been,0
if youll recall with cincinnati and strand traded horse mule men the place kicker now for the bengals to cincinnati in exchange for mcveigh graham,0
of course protected with the incomparable skinner a gain of nine by mcveigh up the middle second down one kansas city baltimore 42 hays the,0

minutes to go in the first half again the tight end shifts out of the backfield richardson number 30 goes wide to the right and,0
off to mcveigh s he was hit by bubba but spun away from him and then he was greeted hard at the line of scrimmage,0
and coming up out of the secondary was number 20 jerry logan im a big bubba number 78 billy ray smith number 74 a short,0
yard on the three sitting play make it second down and nine as dawson looks to mcveigh hits in and warren is out of bound,0
inside the baltimore 25 theyll mark it at the 23 first down kansas city mr dawson throwing to the back a lot of people have,0
thought he might but you didnt know it and sometimes not be able to do much about it 10 minutes 40 seconds to go first,0
half kansas city leading 17 nothing there on the march 1st down at the baltimore 23window hey how about that i bought his scourge his,0
bumbling on the goal line and baltimore recovers grant and both were both down and covering the ball with tom maxwell here he comes the,0

second down and nine baltimore after 21 hill and bullock sets behind unitas johnny to throw he gets his pass away intended for meki and,0
a fine play by middle linebacker willie lanier so near the middle linebacker drops straight back watching the linebacker makes a very good quick move,0
to his left the ball was on target mackey was right behind him and there s intercept in several classes in his career run three,0
of them back for touchdown unitas is now 5 for 14 in passing 9:50 to go first town kansas city leading 17 nothing third down,0

number 75 walking off as john williams offensive guard johnny unitas coming off now 5 for 15 into the game to punt dave lee willie,0
mitchell and in total a car the deep man for kansas city lee hits it at the 11 yard line he did not get all,0
of it but he had pretty good distance and itll roll dead the ball is grabbed by robbie nichols of baltimore a rookie from tulsa,0
kansas city will have the ball first and 10 at their 33 yard line and we have a timeout with 936 remaining the score kansas,0
city 17 baltimore nothing is making a gallon of a low lead gasoline really as simple as this just leaving out most of the lead,0
no because your engine might knock so were going to add to the natural highoctane ingredients now 9 out of 10 drivers can use it,0
without harmful engine milk but a cleaner gasoline should do more so we add a double measure of detergent that reduces exhaust emissions caused by,0
dirty engines and it does something else it improves mileage now you have a low led gasoline plus a high octane gasoline plus a cleaner,0
engine gasoline plus a better mileage gasoline esso big plus priced below most major premiums the lowest led highest octane gasoline for the money big,0
plus it s not only what we took out it s what we put in 9 minutes and 35 seconds to play in the first,0
half kansas city has the ball first in ten just outside the 33 yard line their own 33 the chiefs scored in the first quarter,0
on a 65 yard for play drive lead 7 nothing denna road hit a 28 yard field goal 10 nothing dawson a 13yard pass to,0
home that s where we are 17 nothing let s see what the chiefs do richardson number 30 and pitch number 25 wide receivers both,0
wide to the left they give it off up the middle to mcveigh and mcveigh who is a terror tonight fumble baltimore s got it,0
bob won the football for the coach i dont think ive ever seen so many good place turned out bad here s a great move,0
by mcveigh as he does come in as a good lead block old curtis he s very shifty he s swinging that ball out there,0
he s not supposed to do that and right fairs where somebody pulls it loose and im sorry i missed it bullet loose and fell,0
over it was grant the linebacker 46 yard line baltimore first down unites us looking for the big one goes for boulos it is incomplete,0
jim lynch covered for kansas city there s the unhappy warren mcveigh and the man he replaced in the backfield mike garrett second down 10,0
baltimore at the kansas city 46 with 907 to go in the first half keep deleting 17 nothing prairie the center the baltimore hill 45,0
goulash 36 the setbacks jefferson and henton the wide receivers unitas get away from aaron brown but brown recovers and comes back to get it,0
you can see the forearm shot on vogel s he brought vogel back with him here s the quickness of a guy who s aired,0
brand sixfootseven 255 finn quite a football born mcveigh very upset over having lost the ball after a substantial game has lost his back to,0
the baltimore 42 yard line it s third down in about 22 unitas page to throw and no chance no chance that s brown again,0
here s another look at aaron brown old vogel blue lash actually picks up the wrong man there goulash 436 with tech john from the,0
outside visited where quarterbacks really get hurt brown made a great move to get around and hit jobs the back side obviously that brings up,0
a kickin down and dave lee hit the beauty of a spiral and it drives total act all the way back to this 15 yard,0
line let the big boy from iowa fights his way back to the 27 where kansas city will have it first in 10th right here,0
let s pause five seconds to allow local stations to identify themselves eight minutes 16 seconds to go in the 1st half 1st quarter kansas,0
city went out on top 7 nothing 65 yard foreplay drive then yon stena rude kicked the 28 yard field goal send nothing kansas city,0
a 13yard basket awesome two horns at 17 nothing each club has had a drive stop now kansas city has it back and a handoff,0
is in the middle and certainly not very much room for a fred miller step down on bobby home then just ate him up sale,0
advances one yard for home bring up second down and nine the coats have had 30 offensive plays so far the game the chiefs 20,0
but the chiefs have 17 points in the coast none its mcveigh and home bits and richardson or the wide man or banished the tight,0
end ej hull of the center it was newton number 81 that made first contact for baltimore and spoiled to play billy newsom bubba smith,0
came in to finishing for that draw play to be effective it the play has to really look like the past and that would only,0
didnt much look like a pass all the way and they did read it and smother them up pretty good mike garrett whose spirits are,0
improving as time goes on course he enjoys the 17 point vote well that s a great team man always has been third down and,0
five now for kansas city all is just outside the 22 dustin gives it away inside the mcveigh and nothing curtis is there miller is,0
there and ted hendricks number 83 what is the floor he s got 83 hendricks coming in he s read his play all along it,0
wasnt list 30 32 came through on the other side hendrickson curtis wrapped him up they pried three straight draw plays none of which seem,0
to work darrell wilson will putt for baltimore ron gardein the deep man for baltimore ed wilson hits it spiral dardenne takes it and they,0
rule that he had called fair catch apparently he started to called and decided not to the ball is put down just shy of the,0
40 yard line so this rookie from arizona what he exciting when he gets the chance to run that s the 39 baltimore first down,0
unitas goulash hill jefferson tipton mackie the pass intended for jefferson and wale cannot reach it he was covered by marsalis on the home crowd,0
hooting we noted last week in our football game from cleveland johnny unitas would be the first man to pass 20 miles in total pass,0

to throw goes to the left side for eddie hit and it thomas grabs him and dragged him out of bounds at the 24 yard,0
line first down baltimore at 18 yards pickup on the pass play and earl morel is building into quite a story out of this ball,0
game carl sicne called a pass were on drop when he drops back to pass and he backs out from the center unitas on the,0
other hand turns and comes back just that little bit later first down baltimore kansas city 24 yard line moral to throw goes for the,0
endzone and completes the pass intended for eddie heaven and emmitt thomas was right there girl fields have me back straight back from the center,0
on a pass it gives him better vision into the secondary to see what type of movement the defense what defense are in that particular,0
play unitas feels he can get back quicker and if he turns a little bit and goes back to past he looks over his shoulder,0
still tries to read the defensive secondary throw is doing a very fine job of isolating one receiver on one defensive back this is the,0
primary objective in the passing game to get one man on one man second down in town for the blue plaid baltimore folks at home,0
packed house worrell to throw looks for jefferson and brown and buck buchanan well take a look at it alone a splitscreen marla s going,0
to toto his rider he s trying to throw to his right he gets pressured there looks as if he s going to get away,0

play back to the 35 yard line it is third down and 21 for baltimore at the kansas city 35 the chiefs are leading 31,0
to 711 tend to go in the third quarter theyre all moral moving the coast keeps the russian morals passes away and relax and complete,0

get behind him to take his hands and push a little bit and that s what thomas did on that last play that cost him,0
the head linesman burrell troller was right there on the play well inside the 14 gives the ball to have relax jerry maze makes the,0
tackle on the youngster from bucknell maybe 1/2 yard people have asked me in the past how much difference does it make when you get,0
when you play in a field that has the baseball diamond when you get down on the dirt it makes a great deal of difference,0
in my opinion on the running game and it s a handicap to the defensive backs and they try to keep up with the receivers,0
morale to throw luke sipp jefferson touchdown no he s out of bounds no sir he s that about he might have had one foot,0
in but he did not have enough of the other foot in the touchdown is waived off let s take a look and see what,0
we cant find earl does lob the ball over marcela s head i think he was all the way up there down ball is just,0
inside the 14 yard line kansas city s 14 and here comes earl morrow s in relief of johnny unitas in baltimore s home opener,0
morale going for junior perkins and the past is too long ray perkins who had come on the field replacing jefferson id gone deep into,0

defensive end was a little bit anxious to get in there he votes tell me a pretty good shot itll be third down in 14,0
yards to go for baltimore from their own 20 yard line and theyre saints fans thatll be quite come from with this point leading 34,0

more tina dead ball and is taken by gardein up at the 10yard line and he comes back to the 32 and a penalty flag,0
goes into the pile marvin upshaw was the man who had a hold of him along with cczar beltre and let s wait for the,0
penalty it s apparently against kansas city and it s a big one and it could very well be face guarded a guard yep nope,0
let s take another look at breakfast you see pizzas pattern and he came into the end zone oh he s just trying to make,0
his way across the middle but he sees lineal in he s in trouble you see his six that hand up im going for the,0
corner lenny that s what he said whatever he said was right lenny heard him did he step on the 47 yard line if morrel,0
comes to throw throws for hitmen and eddie s got it and he is down at the kansas city 39 yard line a 14yard pickup,0
for the first down for baltimore earl morel a 15year veteran from michigan state closed for jefferson and it is knocked down by linebacker bobby,0
bell that was a fantastic defensive move by bell he did have his receiver open behind bell but bell looked like he jumped about oh,0
id say 10 or 12 feet in the air and knocked that one down you woke up a lot of high jumpers around the country,0
ill tell you with that track eight or nine what s a very good move they got good depth there kansas city as i mentioned,0
earlier pretty aware of the fact that the baltimore s gonna have to move the ball in the air and havent done that good a,0
job all night second down and 10 from the kansas city 39 morrill to throw going deep for hinton oh no good one of those,0
almost fantastic catches johnny daini number 60 george danny he s been busting those wedges all night that s what s wrong with him he,0
s done a fine job on the kicking things for kansas city for baltimore s 3rd down 10 kansas city 39 mobile sullivan along the,0
front line along with curry laurel has the kansas city defense guessing penalty flag is on the field the pass is caught by roy jefferson,0
at the 30yard line the flag went down before the ball was released marsalis covering jefferson it appears that kansas city was all side keith,0
i imagine the earl s trying to decide whether he wants to take the five yards and give him another down or takes the pass,0
reception i think that was short for the first down yard short decisions decisions decisions ha i dont think again steve ballers put down at,0
the 34yard line as morale does except the penalty to make a third down and five yards to go for the first down mike livingston,0
cranking up for kansas city who may be in at quarterback on the next series in the backfield there was movement jack maitland moving before,0
the snap of the ball that drew all the penalty flags the pass was incomplete the youngster a rookie from williams college number 23 obviously,0
eager now itll be fourth down and five yards to go for baltimore as kansas city declined the penalty sam have relax goes into the,0
backfield for baltimore replacing maitland 12:56 to go in the ballgame the chiefs are on top 41 10 fourth and five the coach will try,0
to get it laurel to throw get this passed away to have relax he is hit at the 29 and he is thrown back hell,0
be close to the first down he could not crushed the body ahead jim tony the referee trying to put the ball down precisely where,0
it stopped though the chain will come on kansas city next week well go to denver and keith we neglected to mention at halftime the,0
denver is unbeaten to an o and kansas city must catch we save them vastly improved broncos as you can see baltimore is just that,0
much short of the first down and kansas city it takes over the ball the cokes will be in boston next week and next monday,0
night we will be in detroit to see a couple of those undefeated teams the bears and the lions mike livingston is now in the,0
ballgame for kansas city number 10 on at quarterback six fours to ten three year men from smu morris stroud number 88 he s in,0
at a tight end position and bobby holmes as borbon one humble and baltimore recover oh brooke it from the 29 on our cross midfield,0
but lost the ball that s a baltimore at the 49 yard line and the coats come up with it and it looked like number,0
74 billy ray smith the 12year veteran from arkansas was on the ball 12 minutes to go in the game baltimore has it their own,0
49 moral gives the ball to bullock 50yard line 1 yard on the play a pretty good example of the speed that bobby bell has,0
you saw him come from a linebackers position and goulashes running nine five or nine six hundred as he cutting the outside bell was with,0
him step for step they are not spending defensive play goolosh was carrying 14 times of the game 34 yards second down nine baltimore midfield,0
mora looking deep throws for mackie attorney defending the pass incomplete flag on the field sammy davis jr guest stars with danny thomas in the,0
new comedy hit make room for granddaddy wednesday night at 8:00 7:00 central time here on abc penalties against the colts 11 22 to go,0
in the game gerry mays number 75 indicating once that he wanted the penalty now rural morals there s something that stops any movement now,0
to go the other way so the penalty flag was thrown against kansas city and it blows it to the 35 yard line where itll,0
be baltimore s ball first and ten first of all number 33 in the game for baltimore at symptoms wide receiver earl morrow statistical story,0
jefferson is wide right morals fast intended for mackey is incomplete jim kearney covering the big crowd yelling for interference matter of fact john mackey,0
s got a couple of words to say about it talk about this crowd there s a feeling of disbelief which i feel from this,0
crowd like this is not the kind of game i expected i dont think this is the kind of game anybody expected baltimore has not,0
played very sharp tonight kansas city is he s been a control of the game since the very beginning and i dont think the fans,0
are or that plays with their hometown true tonight second down and ten for baltimore 88 is macke 15 is moral jefferson is wide to,0
the right maitland and bulan to set back moral to throw gets his pass away kearney intended from becky that would have been another one,0
he had a clear field ahead of them youre right about the baltimore fans done but putting the whole thing into perspective baltimore had tough,0
going they had to play catchup football they started john unitas who was in fan of hampered by the bad nature now the fans are,0
booing both the officials and to a degree their own team earlier they booed john unitas himself and you hate to see that happen yeah,0
you really do john s a great player no question about that and he didnt have a good night and there s no question about,0
that but neither is anyone else for baltimore as far as that goes they really havent played that well theyre down at 10 the folks,0
there s morale fades to throw loops at deep for perkins and it is incomplete double coverage is willie mitchell 22 was back there along,0
with johnny robert so it brings up fourth down for baltimore at the kansas city 35 yard line you talking about playing a good game,0
or a bad game you know it s oftentimes overlooked that the bad game seemed to come when youre playing against real good football players,0
and that might have something to do with it a lot of good ones out there and white ill tell you that baltimore having handled,0
him well in the exhibition game got to be a little stunned by the way theyve been dominated here in the game chiefs are dancing,0
and prancing and almost offside the morals passes away and it s caught by eddie hit i think youd have to say eddie hinton s,0
had a good night he had a good night id like to see him catch him in a crowd and he caught this one in,0
the crowd he ran into a will in there number 63 is that down an end pattern or a cross pattern you see thomas number,0
18 coming in from behind him as he s in the air thomas more less pushes him and causes more momentum as they run into,0
linear i dont think the near moves a niche gun awfully strong middle linebacker a twoyear man from oklahoma eddie hinton was caught seven for,0
89 yards goolosh get back to the line of scrimmage maybe in that s all and that is big aaron brown number 87 getting up,0
off the top of it they passed the hinton was good for the first down when hinton was at oklahoma playing in the big 8,0
oklahoma out of the 8 teams in the big 8 was number 7 in pass attempts and yet he led the conference in past receptions,0
which is an indication that he s been a good receiver for some time he caught 60 passengers between a year four very close to,0
a thousand yards goulashes out of the backfield for baltimore and jerry hill is in replacing him at a stepback position is morale on 2nd,0
and 11th rosehip touchdown if the call is against kansas city the penalty flag is on the field he was against kansas city that was,0
a beautiful throw another good route by hinton so it s a six pointer for baltimore all right and here that young fella for oklahoma,0
comes again youll see thomas and he has his hands oney that s all right there when he got him but we turn he grabbed,0
his shoulder pad a little bit and that is interference call but it didnt slow him down it was a good throw by tomorrow so,0
weve got six points on the board for baltimore and the second touchdown pass of the night for earl morrill 939 to go in the,0
game jim obrien is in it has not caught eight for 110 yards and a touchdown and obrien kick is straight through the uprights so,0
we have a timeout at memorial stadium baltimore with a score now kansas city and 41 baltimore 17 the man who uses this club is,0
a quote he s books robinson of the baltimore orioles a pro who s played third base in every allstar game since 1960 ask this,0
bro who he sees about omkar and business insurance and hed tell you see the pro i see about insurance an independent agent see the,0
pro where you find this big eye symbol he s a member of the national association of insurance agents mike curtis is tough he plays,0
football hard but he wants his hair to be solved that s why i use brokering a little dab leaves your hair saw really natural,0
like it should be brylcreem believes a man should be tough but his hair should be soft brylcreem the bestselling hair dressing in the world,0
baltimore s jim obrien will kick off the coasts go 51 yards in eight plays to get the touchdown warren mcveigh number six and ed,0
podolak number 14 or the deep men for kansas city obrien peeing it up and remember saturday night at 9:30 eastern daylight time ole miss,0
and alabama on abc one of the great college matches of any football year onside kick both have it and he is down at the,0
22 yard line but they will bring it back to the 44 where he picked it up you wont see a better one than that,0
done beautifully executed every time the reason is brought back as the ball can not be as advanced unless it is touched by the receiving,0
team first so he can cover it the ball is baltimore s ball it seems as if they forgot about the onside kick on that,0
one because i didnt see anyone covering part both has great speed was a beautiful onside kick and now baltimore has a little brandnew breath,0
of life 9 minutes and 14 seconds left to play on a ball game a girl morale goes to work may is if after him,0
and brown gets him in shirley cope is in the middle so brown taupe and maids were all coming that s the first time tonight,0
brown has been in there to get the quarterback and talking about that onside kick tim obrien yesterday morning at the baltimore practice came over,0
with sidelines for just a moment picked up some footballs and said to the general manager done klosterman im going to spend the next 20,0
minutes practicing onside kicks and so he did and it paid off here hard work always pays off a loss of 8 yards on the,0
play ray perkins number 27 the end replacing becky has come to the left side as the wide receiver morel back to throw from the,0
48 lofts it downfield for perkins perkins walk open a penalty flag is down another interference tall against willie mitchell very aggressive young man number,0
twentytwo for kansas city he wants to make that ballclub and he s out there hidden make this called offensive holding up in the front,0
everything and that s all i did such a great job wish they would do that with me well ill tell you willie hit him,0
a pretty good strategy came down the sidelines so let s take a look at it take a look at it here as you watch,0
the contact alright here he comes and that is a holding penalty hey you know what so glad dont wear that happen because it gives,0
them a chance to miss and hence there s a difference between defensive holding and defensive pass interference the ball had not been in the,0
air out the throws when he grabbed him five yards automatic first down the ball given to maitland and the youngster from williams college prints,0
all the way down to the 22 yard line 26 yards on the run by jack maitland and thomas brought him down eight minutes and,0
28 seconds to play in the ball game baltimore storming back here in the fourth quarter theyve got a long way to travel theyll take,0
a big storm they put the ball down at the 23 where maitland was shoved out of bounds another first down for the folks the,0
linebackers were coming morale gets it passed away right into the hands of jefferson and then it is knocked loose in a beautiful defensive play,0
by johnny robinson or was it myself this way lee gets up it s marcellus marcellus wrapped his arms around him and jarred it loose,0
marcellus leaves limping some took a pretty good fall and looked at jeff jefferson they have come down on him when they both fell together,0
second down 10 baltimore for kansas city 23 that is eddie hit they reversed and eddie hit who has been quite a performer tonight is,0
down right around the 12 yard line excellent job by thomas as he came in from behind the interference that he had to slow hinton,0
down enough hit and didnt have some blockers out in front of him let s take another look out here comes hit number 33 around,0
you can see the blockers out in front there s thomas number 18 that slowed him down and they will do kansas city pursuits pursuits,0
to catch up with it i like the way maitland handed off to him so that maitland have come in there and as keith mentioned,0
these from william he s a player 12 yard line first down baltimore kansas city 12 fast in and out of the hands of back,0
into the penalty flag on the field again kearney was the defender for kansas city against the chief holding see thomas bright on him and,0
there again he s got the defensive holding he s pushing him pulling impact you know the bay difference between a holding stevenson holding an,0
interference billy penalty is the holding penalty is only a fiveyard penalty well that s right about the 7 yard line the handoff to maitland,0
he s fighting oh look at him put up a battle and the defensive interference building that i was gonna tell you about is whatever,0
that whatever the interaction occurs that s where the ball is marked so that distance could be any number of yards depending on how far,0
down bill the interference ability occurred so the defensive holding facility is only a fiveyard penalty jack maitland took the ball so they for a,0
yard line moving at three yards and as he emerged from the dust storm number 84 tom mitchell who has been hopping on a sore,0
ankle is in at tai dan and mitchell was scheduled to start had he not been hurt maitland again into the middle short of the,0
goal line step touch side he s six one two ten upton bill the personnel director saying that they were tipped off that there was,0
a fine football player up there at williams and they went up to had a look and sure enough third down dole to go that,0
s the to baltimore moral to throw loops it mitchell mackie incomplete kearney several for kansas city so now it is fourth down and goal,0
from the two six minutes eight seconds remaining to play in the ballgame kansas city on top 41 17 tom madi not playing tonight he,0
is on the move list or what amounts to an injured category for two weeks jefferson has timothy the action stopped by the official just,0

city s 21 baltimore 24 the 1971 to real the ford that gives you better ideas for let make it better then price it low,0
that s the whole idea behind torino torino threespeed automatic transmission can operate manually for extra control the leaves six passenger torino is front power,0
brakes are disc brakes for straighter fade resistant stop and those highback bucket seats arent just buckets would separated headrests carino s fourspeed transmission comes,0
with a hurst shifter covino gives you big car options its nearest competition doesnt offer even a heated rear window defroster on top of that,0
torino is the only middle sized car with this choice of roofline sports room and hardtop and it s longer wheelbase gives you a smoother,0
ride the list runs on practically forever but time doesnt so see your ford dealer for the entire torino story torino the ford that gives,0
you better ideas for less 21 the 24 kansas city leading baltimore six minutes and three seconds to play in the game as jim obrien,0
tees it up to kick it off in warren mcveigh number six along with bobby holmes is deep for kansas city i think you can,0
look for earl morale probably to get the starting call next week for the coach onside kick and marsalis covers at the 39 yard line,0
for kansas city and their sam ball one of the veteran offensive tackles for baltimore during some of the wear and tear of the night,0
and the time remaining penalty flag down im gonna go again they kansas city chase their offside what a wrong working to suspect the ball,0
will be teed up on a 45 yard line in the fourth quarter kansas city has had only two offensive plays baltimore has had in,0
the fourth quarter 22 following the news tonight be sure to watch the dick cavett show dicks guests this evening norman mailer dick cavett following,0
the news like they at homes are creeping up they dont really expect obrien to hit this one yeah he goes for the onside kick,0
it s got to go 10 yards and it did not it travels six yards so that s the penalty against baltimore seeing sam ball,0
on the sidelines while ago points up a fact that jerry mays whom paul has been playing in front of or across from all night,0
jerry is that an outstanding game for kansas city in their defensive line defensive captain a 10year veteran with the kansas city chiefs done a,0
fine job well well move back to the 40yard line now and 555 remaining to play on the game no let s see what jimmy,0
can do this time you can hear the kansas city players they look for the onside kick when doe hays grabs it and drops that,0
s the 45 yard line wendell hey johnny unitas on the sideline mike livingston number 10 the quarterback lenny dawson apparently through for the night,0
unless some lightning strikes for baltimore very quickly crowd the big tide in shifting out of the backfield total ack he s tough he goes,0
to the baltimore 42 yard line before tom maxwell gets him down he is tough he s the guy who said when he was a,0
member of the college allstars a year ago when they played the jets that the jets were a bunch of fat old men he s,0
tough with the mouth as well as the body well it s out of the 41 15 yards on the play he s been working,0
all week that s wide receiver in case you might be needed there because of the injured oldest tenant they havent missed otis very much,0
so far tonight bobby home it s just inside the four home bailey 65 miller 76 grant 51 for baltimore he told a picture of,0
unitas on the sideline a while ago with his long hair for years unitas is heather and a crewcut now solving the bobby boyd the,0
coach was a baltimore colts and bobby doesnt have much hair at all and he was comparing his hairdo with united you know unites us,0
now has to comb his and i still just wipe mine off with a rag second down and eight yep just inside the 40 call,0
it to 39 livingston disrobe mike curtis oh did curtis just missed him and coming in from the other side deleon newsome number 81 a,0
lot of blue jerseys in that backfield that time we bitch encouraged many times tonight and mike is an outstanding middle linebacker this is a,0
blitz where he comes off of the move the defensive tackle he s taken a good strong be donal mike livingston from southern methodist university,0
and newsome comes in to put the finishing touches on it newsome took a pretty good lick from bubba smith as he came across to,0
help losses back to midfield nine yards third down and 19 for kansas city chiefs lead 41 20 for the 339 to play that s,0
portal act and ed gets back to the 40 baltimore came with their linebackers that time to baltimore a few years ago was known as,0
a very high blitzing team theyve list a great deal in talking with dawson this afternoon he says they really dont do that anymore unless,0
theyre behind they blitz an average of like 15 percent which is not uncommon lehigh but i would imagine these last quarter youll see the,0
coke blitz quite a bit on fourth down and nine spiner ood is in the ballgame for kansas city he will try a 47yard field,0
goal it s good 47 yards tinaroo hips one and that runs the score up to 44 24 remember saturday night on abc 9:30 eastern,0
daylight time abc ncaa football ole miss and alabama from jackson mississippi archie manning and scott hunter the rebels and the crimson tide one of,0
the great college games of any football season johnston arose from 47 yards makes at kansas city 44 baltimore 24 it s quite a story,0
from a young man who came over to montana state university to do some ski jumping from norway and became one of the most efficient,0
field goal kickers of all time johnny unitas down cast on the sidelines i was looking at the statistics on stena road he was 23,0
out of 23 from inside the 20yard line gardein returning the kickoff for baltimore come back to the 30 theyll give him to the 31,0
yard line maybe oh kickoff return and punt return then amazed me you know they they have a running stride or a style all their,0
own it s a unique talent to do that i guess mainly it s just take the ball and run as fast as you can,0
and hard as you can thorough morale is the quarterback hit him wide to the left morel wants to throw and throws four hips at,0
it he s gunning down he was down before the ball came loose this is an excellent passer open actually throws the ball in a,0
hole youll see him come down again with thomas defending hit and comes back across the middle there s some linebackers in front of her,0
oh this is a very difficult pass to throw you see the linebackers jump that was lynch in front the ball came right in and,0
hit and made another very fine reception we have a timeout with two minutes to play in the ball game in our score kansas city,0
44 baltimore 24 while most of you like the taste of benson &amp; hedges 100 some of you really appreciate the 3 4 maybe even,0
5 moments more they give you 3 4 maybe even 5 moments more than king size this is big al hirt saying that you need,0
only two things when you go fishing lots of miller high life and a little bit of luck hey look at that man big dad,0
that deserves a miller party robust deep down good miller high life the champagne of beers that last cats for 23 yards gives eddie hat,0
in the total of nine receptions for the night 132 yards and a touchdown and the story on our own moral you see earl came,0
on late in the second quarter and it s been effective first down at the kansas city 47 yard line morel throws intended for perkins,0
it is intercepted by emmitt thomas he s hobbling along and he is finally knocked out about that is the fourth interception the second for,0
thomas they have pulled a charley horse to look like in his legs he made his cut there i get a report on that a,0
minute earl got a little pressure from the defensive line they were closing in on him a little bit like he released it s possibly,0
a little bit high the balls may have taken off on him or floated a little bit it did go with a head of his,0
intended receiver and you do that against this kansas city secondary and youre gonna get it picked off the ball is on the 37 yard,0
line kansas city first down and there s emma thomas woof theyre playing with that knee yeah sure livingston the quarterback odor lacks get the,0
yard emmitt thomas i tell you a loss of this fellow would really be a loss in anybody s secondary he is a fine football,0
player i didnt see him get hit on that knee possibly he may have turned it as he made his cut i hope it s,0
not his knee and it s just a charley horse he worked those things that those knees they take quite a while second down and,0
nine at the 38 for kansas city livingston number 10 quarterback bobbie home after about the 40 and fred miller calls time defensive captain so,0
baltimore spends one of its precious timeout with 58 seconds to go in the ballgame the executive producer of abc sports is roone arledge nfl,0

directors bill morris and wrong truckers the engineering supervisor roy robbins unit manager joe bush assistant to the producer dilyara husband understatement i think the,0
balance that kansas city has as a entire team is certainly a key to their success theyve got fine defense offense and a great kicking,0
game and that pretty well covers it out third down and seven yards to go for the chiefs and theyre staying on the ground as,0
livingston hands it away to head podolak and again baltimore spends the timeout with 53 seconds to play in the game and there s a,0
gentleman at abc who enjoyed his retirement party tonight i am sure henry hed after 43 years he s gonna take it easy we certainly,0
and all of us here at abc sports want to wish merry the very best happy months of leisure ahead for him happy years the,0

giants and the detroit lions second down and nine for the minnesota vikings from the 36 pazzo is back to throw the ram over running,0

like it is right now of course that s the thing that everyone says does cause a great deal of problems in boston ball handling,0
and it certainly does that was not a real good pitch back to the fullback that time it looked like it s a little bit,0
hard but im sure the are excited allan page comes up with the recovery i think jim marshall also had a hand in it the,0

against him last year in the title game second down for viking paul just outside the 36 puzzle bitches osborn cuts inside and theyre the,0
pursuers get it both in the defensive philosophies of these teams are very similar as keep falling out at the top of the game they,0
rely great deal on their their front four they put on a good rush to contain the running game their linebackers main responsibility is the,0
drops in area and cover area cut coverage and also the pursuit that these linebackers give is you saw that last play it s also,0
a very instrumental thing defensive coverage scores in sweeps are concerned the van the rams called the secretary of defense david jones made the last,0

the tackle for the ran it s close to a first down and it is the first down for the minnesota vikings their third as,0
i visited with quaza before this game one of the things that he did tell me he says the rams have had a tendency in,0
the past any time they played against me when he was at baltimore to blitz more than they show on their tendency and he saw,0
a blitz therefore the early in the ballgame we may see that later on first down vikings ball up their own 41 bob graham is,0
wide light pazzo has he looks he flows back to the other side to us to read read headedness tummy interrupted read had it right,0
in his hands getting coverage from myron patio said he dropped it the viking fans holler give the give the seed to read and that,0
time the seed was either little wet or we couldnt hold on to it ball with a little bit under thrown but it did get,0
there and he just dropped it he was mantoman on the middle linebacker mayan patios kaiser that happens when the a roll type pattern comes,0
out he came out of the back field that was batiatus man man for man that s a good matchup he can get it every,0
time bill brown is in the ball game replacing reed bill brown needs just 22 more yards to become the 13th man in history to,0
"gain 5,000 yards in the nfl pazzo on second down it gives it to bill brown and brown strikes from the 41 to about the",0

take another look at the fumble that gave minnesota this chance you always hate to see a fumble really if any can because it breaks,0
the rhythm of a ball game that just hit him right in the hands and i suppose the ball is a little bit wetter than,0
what we give it credit for and the vikings did recover the fumble that thumb up in great field goal position there is a big,0
break that the vikings and the pressure right now on the los angeles defense far so kids osborne up the middle koya becomes one of,0

you get an idea of the tremendous anticipation and even if you will anxiety that exists along that front line the rams were the ones,0
guilty of moving this time i know this looks funny a lot to folks at home when they see a defense jump offsides like that,0
and there s lots of diffuser and they wind up calling a penalty against the offense but the rule says the office declare after he,0
steps in his stand he cannot move now if the ball does not stop the offensive man has an opportunity to get back across that,0

looking group of people of folks second down and seven from the 17 gabriel gives it to larry smith then the big youngster from florida,0
is at the 20 before the middle of the minnesota line collapses on him and leading that collapse is lonnie warwick middle linebacker number 59,0
done the reason i as you know i mentioned mistakes earlier george allen teaches this man minimized the mistakes the penalties the interceptions the fumbles,0
because allen knows he doesnt have the swiftness and the offensive backfield or even in the wide receivers to strike long and with immediately they,0
have to do everything the hard way 1120 to go 1st half vikings lead 7 nothing third down three yards to go for the rams,0
at their 20 gabriel has it he throws to smith larry is caught he had a first down i think the ballers were the officials,0
aborted bed minnesota vikings have a football ellen page audrey it was the man that came up with it alan page he was turned into,0
one of the biggest teams from the national football league this year he is something has it s on that defense is known again and,0
howard just talking about the mistakes youll see how it pays again number 88 he s a great defensive player all around he puts on,0
a good rush he does have a habit of being where that ball is he s come up with a cup he came up with,0
interception for a touchdown this year youll see him there pick up the fumble those vikings know when paige gets the ball he s heading,0
for the goal line wally hillenburg helped him out a little bit while him as a matter of fact might have helped knocked the ball,0
loose to get the ball to alan it s on the 14 first down pazzo goes for the corner hindustani that was a good gutsy,0
call you throw everything out in the flat with a guy like clancy williams covered and it flipped a little bit in this weather you,0
know that there s a possibility im picking up picking it off and going all the way but there was a good call and a,0
good catch by henderson and its first down and goal to go for the minnesota vikings as they try to cash in on another ram,0
mistake make the big play and it s been the defense making the big play this season for the minnesota vikings call it the three,0
and a half yard line first and goal to go flint jones in it running back they give it to osbourne he stacked up behind,0
the line of scrimmage merlin olsen number 74 maxie vaughn number 55 for the ram dont know whether you notice the rams made a slight,0
shift in their defensive line right at the last minute there they did ship the line over to whether the play actually came and a,0
little bit too late for cazzo to audible so they ran right into the strength of the lines of the defensive line of the rams,0
second down go to go call at the 4yard line tangle ha gives to croisé oh plaza in trouble and pry bacon hammers in take,0
a look at quas knows he fakes the hand off his on a rollout pattern he wants to throw youll see bacon number 79 as,0
he comes up bacon made a good move to keep to the outside to contain the run stuff wausau made a great move to come,0
in there throw him down for a loss i think puzzle actually had on a brown or one of the facts that was opened on,0
a flare pass back in the end zone he couldnt get it to him a loss of 12 yards back to the 16 yard line,0
it s third down and goal to go from the 16 that s bill brown going up the middle he s now past the five,0
thousand yard mark he s back inside the five to the fourth thurman alexander on the tackle for the round the left side of that,0
minnesota offensive line grady alderman 67 who is the lone remaining original viking and ed white during quite a job blocking so itll be fourth,0
down the ball is just short of the five yard line and they minnesota field goal unit has come on the field look at the,0
fuse in there the fella that keeps the downs over here on the sideline it failed to put that fourth down marker up those vikings,0
i think were going to try to slip out an extra down on them they didnt realize this was on national tv if we kept,0
them brad cox will fire the extra point number four try the field goal number 14 talks with 51 points as he started tonight the,0
extra point after the touchdown he has to as he stands there he will regain the scoring lead in the national football conference if he,0
is successful with this field goal he led the nfl in sporting last year earl mann of the court at 10 points yesterday for a,0
total of 53 points david ray has 49 points right now a zero in on fred cox from the 13 yard line it s good,0
and we have a timeout here in minnesota and our scoreboard now read the minnesota vikings 10 the los angeles rams nothing on a very,0
wet cold rainy night fred stands to kickoff for the minnesota vikings after the field goal dribbles it along the ground it again is picked,0
up by one of the wedge men at corinth and curran who knows what to do with the football brings it all the way back,0
through their los angeles 38 yard line where the rams will have it first and 10 wally hildenburg made the tackle for minnesota coming up,0
next saturday on abc ncaa regional college football california usc nebraska colorado south carolina georgia holy cross buffalo consult your local listings for the time,0
of the game in your area and those in the east schedule to see california usc will be watching the powerful nebraska cornhuskers and colorado,0
instead now here come the los angeles rams first and 10 as roman gabriel stops to pass and his intended receiver window tucker downfield fell,0
down and gave just unloaded it well los angeles has field position now keith and theyve got to start to make a move because early,0
as it is and although there s a long way to go and anything can happen as they always say there s no tougher team,0
to play catch up football against than the minnesota vikings id like to amplify what i said earlier mr reeves the owner of the rams,0
is reported to us dead not be back as coach even if they win the super bowl as a distinction between reported to its head,0
and actually hearing the statement isnt that the truth second out and dead inside handoff and the leather really snapped on that one number 88,0
allen paige was the first man to get to the ball carrier along with gary larson who slid across his the allen pace number 88,0
he made a great move to the inside actually nobody touched him and a guy that big and that maybe look like a very simple,0
move but now there s not very many folks that can make that kind of move so he s a difficult man to block on,0
and he s certainly a problem for any offensive team when if youre gonna run up the middle larry smith had two yards third down,0
eight from the 40 for the rams vikings leading 10 nothing eller gets back maybe you didnt penalty flags are down gabriel looking for someone,0
to throw to and cannot get rid of it and again it s alan page number 88 knocking the los angeles quarterback down while we,0
await the penalty done im surprised that the trouble gabe is having getting rid of the ball because one would have expected him based on,0
the game plan he disclosed to us to throw quick later was backs flaring out ought to his tight in and he looked he was,0
looking deep then yeah he said that he thought he would start with a screen pass howard maybe die kind of the model a bit,0
and see what they do the the vikings do run his own through the strong side in the weak side so maybe he s checking,0
them out some way that he didnt tell us about fiveyard off side minnesota moves the ball to the 45 yard line rams third down,0
theyve got to go just over the 48 to get the first down about three and a half yards on third down okay roman to,0
throw again he s having trouble finding people he cannot get away jim marshall knocked him down the football is loose but the rams retain,0
possession so the old pigskin is pretty slick tonight and down in the bottom ken im at number 50 the man that came up for,0
the ball and kept it for los angeles that tells you something about the efficiency of the minnesota secondary that s two times in a,0
row gabriel just simply couldnt find anybody to throw to the ball is back at the 39 yard line on 4th and nine that stud,0
still is in the front the deep men are bob grimm and charlie west for the minnesota vikings and stud steel s kick a low,0
liner goes to west he takes it at the 26 27 yard line he comes back about two yards before his feet are jerked out,0
from under him by bob klein at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota we have a timeout with six 36 to play in the first half,0
of the score the minnesota vikings 10 the los angeles rams nothing the minnesota vikings own the football with six 36 to go in the,0
first half the ball is set their own 29 yard line first down gary quas o with osborne and brown behind it and it s,0
osborne slipping poo and again he got great blocking from the left after the 48 yard line before kermit alexander and eddie emitter make the,0
tackle for the ram 11 yards on the play right here let s pause five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves the,0
minnesota vikings now have nine first downs one for the rams the vikings lead 10 nothing second quarter six minutes to play in the first,0
half pazzo gives it to dave osborne and osborne is dragged down back at the 37 yard line and dyer own talbert number 72 at,0
the factor for the round the minnesota vikings grab the lead in the first quarter capitalizing on a los angeles fumble took it in from,0
the 18 yard line a scoring strike from kwas oh to brown of 17 yards and then fred cox has kicked a 13 yard field,0
goal and the vikings have a 10 nothing lead with 5:25 to go in the first half second down and 14 back at the 36,0
lambs defense dancing around for slipping through back up to the 43 yard line for the minnesota vikings this time it s eddie matter coming,0
out of the secondary with help from koi bacon on the time they taking a pretty good shot at the newest members of that fearsome,0
foursome and koi bacon and darent albert over there and this is not unusual this is a kind of expected thing it seems like guy,0
if you find a new face in the lineup that s what you want to do is check him out not that these guys are,0
that new but youve certainly heard a little bit more of deacon jones and merlin olsen so they may continue that well just have to,0
wait and see ball is at the 43 third down seven minnesota theyve got to go to midfield to get the first down pazzo keeps,0
on the sneak he gets to the 46 and that s all number 66 myron patios middle linebacker stop down so minnesota will have to,0
kick it away plated touches done i dont know what that is that s the night like the quarterbacks i know he called a quarterback,0
sneak on third and eight tom mcneal number 12 is in the front as gary quas oh goes to the sidelines like neela s kicked,0
twice for a 38 yard average under his normal average the deep man is alvin haman haman back at the 18 slips he slides and,0
fie down he goes alden heyman is brought down by dale hack part number 49 weve seen a little pilfering and a little thievery out,0
here on the field so far in this first half and it s probably a good thing to have burt reynolds with us tonight detective,0
dan auguste and youll see him search out an elusive lure breaker wednesday night at 10:00 9:00 central time on abc he s my favorite,0
policeman rams ball first down 26 yard line vikings lead 10 nothing let s see what the rams can do they can get it going,0
gabriel gives it to lester josephson and the vid yang stir from mineola minnesota comes up and gets no more than two went down the,0
three 15 left to play in the half keith and it reminds me of the situation a year ago when los angeles los angeles and,0
everything going for it in the first half and led against minnesota in the western conference title game 17 to 7 at halftime now the,0
10 point differential favors minnesota give him one yard on the previous play make it second down and nine from the 27 gabriel stays with,0
a running game karl eller number 81 jim marshall number 70 on the defensive play for the minnesota vikings and no romans aware of this,0
we talked about it before the ball game is he pointed out there s the worst thing you could do against the zone defense team,0
is to force yourself or you force your passing game into his own because weve thought weve talked about the zone many times these people,0
are covering areas that theyre and it seems that he s been a little pressured for some reason to try to force his patterns we,0
may see him come back a little bit later and pick out the short ones third down and seven from the 29 gabriel back to,0
throw nobody to throw to he finally unloads it to leicester josephson it is short and incomplete jim marshall was the man really putting the,0
heat on gabriel and forced him finally to on logan well let so we have a minute 57 to play in the first half nfl,0
monday night football will continue from metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota with our score the vikings 10 in the rams nothing well the music indicates,0
some of the joy that is loose right now here in minnesota as the vikings lead the rams 10 nothing pet stud still will putt,0
for los angeles on fourth and seven charlie west and bob grim are deep that doesnt get all of it it s a high kick,0
but quite short and it takes a viking bounce and comes back upfield to the 48 yard line and their minnesota will have it first,0
and 10 the vikings have dominated the first half coming up at halftime howard cosell well have highlights of nfl action for you the dallas,0
kansas city game detroit chicago green bay philadelphia and the new york giants big win over the st louis cardinals that s touch still getting,0
only 23 yards on that funk dont you guys go talk to those cowboys last week somebody did something garrick was oh at the trigger,0
for the vikings back to throw he had a moment and then suddenly that moment was gone as the rams penetrated merlin olsen and died,0
on calvary he just kind of filled that when all these guys come bouncing in there and there comes one here comes another one that,0
s a dentist back here with that football he s an orthodontist and then when it was finished number one in his class interesting those,0
story they wonder why i want to be in it is an orthodontist does that right key just after time and his comment was that,0
he wanted people to come to him when he werent in pain i thought that was kind of an interesting little twist a reason to,0
be an orthodontist on second down and 18 and off goes to bill brown in the middle and there is no room for mr brown,0
this time as myron patios number 66 and deacon jones number 75 stopping the ball is now back at the minnesota 39 this series started,0
up at the 48 so it is going to be third down and 19 jim nettles number 19 just checked into the rams secondary replacing,0
myron adios on this third and 19 so obviously the rams expect past pazzo gives it the bill brown and brown fighting to get loose,0
is tripped by jack pardee who s quite a football story in himself itll be fourth down and about 23 yards to go and there,0
s the time remaining in the first half the vikings head on to nothing lead and they have thoroughly dominated this first half of play,0
american juneau are aware of the tragic plane crash which killed 30 players and friends at wichita state university football team october 2nd we join,0

block willie ellison may have gotten a piece of it it s a very short kick herman alexander on the side he may go all,0
the way he is down here lindsey dragged him down at the 2 yard line for minnesota how quickly news things turn around we see,0
accented him at 39 and alexander was a running back in college so he knows what to do with that ball when he gets it,0
makes a good move down the sideline he is given great save there just to bring him down just short of the goal i will,0
see if the rim can get it in that could turn this thing around in the second half the ball is on the minnesota 2,0
yard line first and goal to go los angeles a 49 yard return of that partially deflected and i believe it was partially deflected by,0
ellison number 33 19 seconds remain to play in the first half roman gabriel trying to cash in on this big opportunity for los angeles,0
lester joseph s son is down to the goal line but he is not in time called by los angeles 11 seconds to play in,0
the first half what a turn of events as you said what a break for los angeles when most it needed it we talked before,0
about george ellen one of his most daring traits took place in the last offseason when he sent his place kicking specialist fruit gossiped up,0
to san francisco poor kermit alexander an elected to go when a youngster came up to the big time as a wide receiver named david,0
ray ray came through in a clutch situation against green bay last week to break at 21 to 21 tied alexander is evidencing his values,0
tonight and the allen theory is i respect specialists but if i can get a man who s a total athlete i want it under,0
crisis condition hell react the way a total athlete should and to placekicker 111 seconds left to play as you see in this the first,0
half at the rams can get this over well it s a threepoint differential and des everyone would say a brand new both side ends,0
truax and flying are in the ballgame now second down and go from about two feet away gabriel quarterback sneak he did not make it,0
good but it looks like he is crawling in galaxy just hold everything whether or not the rams were able to call time before time,0
expires the indication apparently is that gabriel on the quarterback sneak did manage to call time before time expires wally hill gandhara arson were already,0
off the field but gabriel keeping the ball on the quarterback sneak immediately call time when he heard the whistle gabriel tries again he did,0
not make it he did were taken under braking because the liver that was for a long time to come oh my we have come,0
to the end of the first half with our score a minnesota vikings 10 the los angeles rams nothing howard cosell well be back with,0
a look at the highlights of yesterday is in fl action right after this metropolitan stadium bloomington minnesota the halftime score 10 to nothing and,0
this was the final play of the half with the vikings leading by that 10 to nothing count roman gabriel over his center kenny ayman,0
for the second time in a row virtually at the goal auto back keeper for the second time in her own not getting past the,0
purple gang and the frustration will probably live with the rams throughout the half time period what a job for a coach to get a,0
team back up after that kind of disappointment three shots they had from inside the three yard line they couldnt put it across after the,0
great faith break on the punt return by kermit alexander ten to nothing minnesota now as is our usual procedure at halftime every monday night,0
through the courtesy of nfl films the highlights of some of the key games of the recent weekend and so let s pick up with,0
that pregame festivities at kansas city the super chiefs about to take on the dallas cowboys it s early in the first quarter first time,0
the chiefs have the ball they recover the dallas bumble on the dallas 31 lenny dawson hits number 30 gloucester richardson who goes out on,0
the dallas five quickly then the chiefs are ready to assume an early lead and just three plays late in the handoff goes to ed,0
podolak out of iowa he sweeps right in behind good blocking by moore and the chiefs with the conversion have a seven to nothing lead,0
over the cowboys podolak becoming a more consequential figure in kansas city scheme of things since the trading of mike garrett to san diego but,0
now were in the third quarter and dallas is leading 13 to 10 dawson looks for number 18 i noticed ella but finds instead mel,0
renfro with the interception dallas has field position on the chiefs 47 just two plays later galvan hill sidelined with back problems blaine thomas becomes,0
the work boss number 33 watch him go all the way in for the touchdown alex assumes a commanding lead of 20 to 10 that,0
young man has a tremendous potential wayne thomas now this is the next time the cowboys have possession a screen pass from craig morton to,0
dwayne thomas again thomas bolts down the sidelines and nobody s going to get him this time either an apparent touchdown 72 yard play but,0
only apparent cowboys detected holding the ball call back this didnt deter morton it s just two plays later craig finds the incomparable speedster the,0
former olympic champion bob hayes who has no trouble out racing emmitt thomas this was a game that dallas commanded city mustard later field goals,0
the final score dallas 27 into city 16 and bob hayes in the doghouse earlier this year is very much out of it now now,0
this is detroit at chicago wrigley bill the two met earlier in a game covered by abc and this one began the same way as,0
the earlier one with concannon looking for in finding dick gordon who beats limbani for the third time this year and quickly the bears have,0
a surprising 7 to nothing lead the bass had momentum it seemed in the first half detroit mustered a field goal now with the score,0
7 to 3 concannon finds george palmer and that s number 20 limb barney beaten again rama goes all the way down to the 4,0
yard line of the lions bears seem ready to take full control of the ballgame but you see the pom book recovered by the lions,0
and so the first half ended their seven reliance great disappointed content now detroit moved to seven at six in the second half and this,0
became the big play quarterback billy months a perfect strike to earl mccullough the fleetfooted wide receiver before such olympic action imported a play professional,0
football so in a bruising game detroit hung on for a 16 210 victor closer than expected but still a victory now were back live,0
at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota the vikings enjoying a 10 to nothing halftime edge after a thrilling but frustrating for the rams end of,0
the half when they couldnt move it in after three chances from inside the vikings 3 well look at more nfl action after this message,0
that s philadelphia eagles coach jerry williams he saw his team jump in front of green bay at milwaukee with an early field goal 3,0
to nothing but the rookie quarterback rick arrington number 11 is to have his troubles an interception by doug hart number 43 of the packers,0
doug returns the ball 76 yards for a packer score putting seven to three they were in crunch to stay del livingston had a field,0
goal and made it ten to three but after the kickoff watch this return by billy wallet he finds that one hole that s necessary,0
speeds down the sidelines they have chased by young kim ellis the rookie from southern university to fine out of bounds but it was an,0

3 in the second half talking tonight up only slightly this one is 2 bob tucker it s another touchdown and amazingly the giants had,0
upset st louis 35 to 17 st louis now in a 4 up and 2 down tie with the dallas cowboys that s the scene,0
here at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota the rain pouring down a veritable plethora of fumbles in the first half which was dominated by the,0
minnesota vikings tend to nothing as you read the score but the statistics make it even more so nine first downs for vikings only one,0
for the rams 110 yards offensively for the vikings only 38 for the rams total number of offensive plays 36 for the vikings only 20,0
for the rams nearly twice as many and of course the major differential was in russia because minnesota used the ground game most effectively now,0

what a nine continues to fall there are the statistics they speak i think for themselves meanwhile what a way to come back from frustration,0
of payment had been able to break the whole thing even so weve given them good field position he brought it back 41 42 yards,0
call at the 36 make the kick return 42 yards first down los angeles roman gabriel is the quarterback and gabe goes right back to,0
throw he swings it out to lester josephson then josephson is caught around the ankles and dropped by bobby eight brian there will be a,0
gain on the play from the 36 up to the 38 second down eight coming up there a look at the defensive front for for,0
minnesota don what do you suppose george allen told his judges at halftime after that first happened he had a lot of things he cooks,0
that i dont know which one he did a second down at eight decks no is wide right bob long number 86 starting at a,0
wide receiver position is wide left the handoff to westar josephson a fine effort by josie and josephson is knocked out of bounds by paul,0
crouch number 22 first down at the viking 42 yard line incredible away he s come back from that ruptured achilles tendon operation especially a,0
relatively advanced year that may be the most difficult of all injuries to come back actually anybody do well nice folks do well and he,0
really is a real nice guy im very happy to see him back running in a good good form again josie picked up 20 yards,0
on the play call at the 43 yard line first down los angeles in minnesota country gabriel still got it i dont know how to,0
really describe what s happening any better than maybe you can describe it at home but really and truly it just seems like everything the,0
dreams try to do they theyre just not the right place and that was the playaction pass that didnt clear out really as well as,0
some playaction passes should now roman you see roman on the sidelines he did get a pretty good shot there to the nose speaking from,0
nose injuries that that one will come back carl sweet 10 is the new quarterback let s take a look at him sweet ten number,0
ten the ball is now back at the los angeles 49 yard line second down and 21 they give it away to larry smith and,0
smith trying to get around the corner cannot turn that corner as the minnesota defense reacts very well lonnie warwick number 59 knocked him out,0
of our house wheaton number 10 i know george allen has a great deal of confidence in sweet then he has been around the league,0
at a few clubs before he made the ram stop but he seems to give them the type strength they need he s the great,0
support man far roman roamin very seldom get hurt gets hurt but when he does they have some confidence in sweet man third down and,0
about 17 yards to go the handoff is inside on a trap play and it doesnt work for much as larry smith gets to about,0
the minnesota 46 yard line they had to go down to the 33 to get their first down so the los angeles rams have a,0
decision here with the ball resting at the minnesota 47 yard line roman gabriel has been sacked three times tonight with a total of 18,0
yards and with a weather condition being what they are the rams will punt the deep men charlie west and bob graham and pat stud,0
still will hit it from about his own 42 yard line baton for punts in the first half averaged thirty three and a half yards,0
well under his normal season average the kick is away this one s pretty good when charlie west looks at it it bounces on down,0
and it is got to be marked down at about the 5yard line just outside the five as the rams put it down and we,0
have a timeout here at metropolitan stadium in minnesota with a minnesota vikings leading the los angeles rams by a score of tendinopathy number 18,0
standing on the sidelines in white there is roman gabriel the los angeles rams quarterback he s been sacked three times for loss of eighteen,0
yards he left the game with a bloody nose perhaps the injury could be greater well wait and see meantime minnesota has it first down,0
on their own 6yard line and croisé o gives to dave osborne and osborne gets it up to about the eight yard line before maxie,0
bon the outside linebacker and ricci pettibone make the tackle for the round here for a quarterback standpoint i really think this is probably the,0
worst kind of weather that you can have to play in it primarily because it does affect everybody and it affects all phases of the,0
game when the ball is wet and slippery you cant have it that well your receivers are not going to hold onto it your runners,0
cant get good footage so it s really a it s not a good night and im sorry we have it for this type of,0
ballgame second down make it a three yard advance / osborne second down and seven the handoff goes to bill brown and bill is across,0
the ten up to about the 11 before he s knocked off his pins running in behind ed white and grady alderman and darin talbert,0
made the tackle for los angeles in the vein that done just touched upon we had six fumbles in the first half four by los,0
angeles the rams lost three of them two by the vikings they lost both you cant really panic in a situation like this but i,0
know the vikings are thinking about we cant again afford to do anything that would cause these fumbles or interception so theyve got to kind,0
of play it cautious ten fifteen to go third quarter vikings lead ten nothing long count dave osborne dropped at the 10yard line david jones,0
deacon jones and maxi baum another chance now with this forthcoming punt for the los angeles rams to get good field position but remember the,0
rams at the moment without roman gabriel out with a bloodied nose helmet torn off his head by rush by loss roman of course the,0
player of the year in the nfl a year ago so a critical commodity to this randy number 12 tom mcneil will punt for minnesota,0
averaged 28 yards on four kicks in the first half rain continues to come down on this soggy night hits it a lowdriving kick kaman,0
backs up takes it falls down at the los angeles 40 but he gets up around the corner he s still going and he has,0
finally dragged down as the vikings recovering enough of him get ahold of him to knock him off his pins milk sundae number 64 the,0
man who knocked him out well take a look at this oh no again when a field is not in a real good playing conditions,0
youll see him fall down this throws off the timing of everybody so the defensive men that are coming down cant seem to get a,0
good move on heyman is a great kick return man gosh just him doing the dance on the side that reminds me the deke dude,0
dance team across this great field position and he gained 14 yard two picked off 14 on the run back timeout minnesota the score vikings,0
10 rams nothing los angeles rams first down at the minnesota 36 yard line as a result of the stirring run by alvin heyman roman,0
gabriel is back in the ball game he s been repaired and gabriel is back to throw slips and delivers it is complete to the,0
tight end billy truax and he is dropped at the 31 by lonnie warwick the middle linebacker that s what he s going to have,0
to do more and more of dont you agree done those quick pops yeah i think you will he s got to establish something that,0
s consistent the truax has not been used tonight he is a good receiver has been a consistent receiver for the rams roman is back,0
in there romans their leader and as they say leaders are lonely but they lead a good life theyve got to have roman back in,0
there he s the guy for leadership second down five los angeles at the minnesota 31 lester josephson second effort gets into the twenty nine,0
mr page and mr marshall you see were there you get back that huddle you look around it rains coming down all over you and,0
you see somebody like the minnesota vikings crossed runyan you look back in you manually what have i got in my game plan well you,0
know your game plan has been hampered by the weather because youre not gonna be able to do as many things effectively so you got,0
to think how can i do it well and consistent so you got to go to things that you believe in though blocks turn in,0
maybe a screen pass third down three yards to go for the round at the minnesota 29 gabriel the throw he dumps at the larry,0
smith smith falls down at the 30 gets up gifts one yard to the 28 maybe the 27 he is short of the first down,0
i really pull in for anybody up here but you know i hate to see you as least this caliber really be hampered like this,0
and that was a great screen it was tough to the right side and it smith made his turn putting just went out from under,0
e and i dont know what they made it first down or not but theyve got to do things like that to keep these drives,0
going well they had to go to the 26 yard line to get the first down from our angle i would say the ball is,0
short by at least a half a yard but let s wait and see as the chain gain comes on seven minutes and 29 seconds,0
to play in the third quarter the vikings are leading 10 to nothing and it s more like a full yard short isnt stick another,0
look at the play if see roman he s going to set up this dream pass and what he s trying to do of course,0
is make it look just like a pass down still made a quick step there was smith im a 38 out there second there he,0
s just good to stay up on his feet number 16 the rams will go for it david ray is not in the ball game,0
on fourth down and one from the 27 the ram trailing 10 nothing frustrated in this rainy night and on this soggy field against the,0
powerful vikings will try for the first down gabriel has it throws it is caught by very true accent billy truex steps out of bounds,0
down at the minnesota 16 yard line as done meredith knows that was a great and gutsy call and they learned their lesson trying for,0
the shorty audits against that purple gang earlier at the end of the last half i think this is really one of the most entertaining,0
things in football gosh you know it s the fourth down and it s a big team i like to see folks call plays like,0
this truex to it put it all out on the line is what it s doing truax does his thing rowland did his thing so,0
well see what happens first down for the rams their third first down of the ballgame first down at the minnesota 16 mitch johnson number,0
70 in at tackle gabriel dumps it to larry smith and smith is knocked out of bounds by roy winston number 16 who backed into,0
the play and then coming out of the second theyre actually looping around the middle linebacker lonnie warwick we look this from the end zone,0
youll see again this is a very similar play that we looked at while ago again rolling sets up but again you see his offensive,0
line sweep out to the right and set up in front of larry smith this time he catches it and instead of cutting back he,0
s gonna try to go around winston does make a good move plays off a block comes in nilka brand number 89 also did a,0
good job of closing that stream play off not gonna get anything cheap on these vikings theyre well skilled and good football players give him,0
one yard short yard make it second down and mine from about the 15 mommy mason in the backfield for los angeles pass into the,0
end zone intended for jack snow is incomplete bobby bryant was right there roman gabriel now 8 out of 12 for 52 yards in his,0
passing you know when you have a broken nose and i had about 8 or 10 of those things that people used to ask me,0
how much do they affect him they dont affect you that much of course unless there s a lot of swelling which does occur sometimes,0
in a broken ocean you cant see it impairs your vision but theyre painful if it s real cold out there which is not really,0
that cold a night it makes it a little bit more difficult to breathe bob long is wide to the left snow flip to the,0
right mason the white shirt in the backfield for the los angeles rams on 3rd down and 9 gabriel de throw gets his passed away,0
into the end zone the intended receiver was jax no he slipped and was held up by by the drive a passes in completed his,0
fourth down and now we get david ray number 27 in for the field goal try david ray starting tonight at a total of 49,0
points in scoring the leading scorer for the los angeles rams fred cox has now moved into the lead in the national football conference with,0
a total of 55 including the points tonight earl mann detroit has 53 and if david ray is successful from the 23 yard line he,0
will have 52 richie pettibone number 17 is gonna hold richie former quarterback from tulane angle from the right hash mark or the left as,0
you look at it and david ray who kicked the pressurepacked field goal last week for the ram is straight through the middle eight plays,0
36 yards we have a timeout here in minnesota with a store now the minnesota vikings 10 the los angeles rams 3 let jones charlie,0
west are deep for the minnesota vikings as david ray s sets to kickoff for the los angeles rams the rams getting on the board,0
at 9:05 gone in the third quarter and the score is now 10 to 3 the range still pelting down and ray hits it well,0
knocks it down to the oneyard line was that dont fix it up look out he s that hole and the last man the shopper,0
on him there s a very muddy shirt underneath him though and let s give some credit to alvin haman number 23 you see jones,0
he s got great acceleration he s the big back he s following that front for up there in foam he s trying to split,0
the thieves which he does right here again i think the field conditions dictate a run like this because you get kent cutting real well,0
he just ran right straight ahead and david ray was the last man and he brought it back 41 yards gary quas oh the quarterback,0
bill brown in vail osborne are the running backs the baby balls for minnesota osborne left side beautiful hole and myron patios gets the job,0
done that s a 45 yard line the gain from the 40 to make it 3 yard second down 7 coming up with the development,0
of clint jones has been one of the happy things for the minnesota vikings he came out of michigan state as you all know a,0
heralded football player but didnt come on in his first couple of years now he is a key figure in that minnesota attack realizing upon,0
all the potentially had at michigan state second down 7 plazo back to throw throws it is incomplete hit a los angeles rams over there,0
the pass was intended for ours born in washington the wide receiver had slipped through there a maxie bond got a handoff with incomplete dickwad,0
take a look you really didnt luck this time when he threw had that one back maxi bomb very experienced number 55 youll see you,0
hit max youve kind of right in the hands but get it up steady but grant didnt lock that either i dont imagine mr sunshine,0
himself right here in his friend s name pazzo now 5 for 9 46 yards one touchdown third down they need seven short seven slipping,0
through the middle comes over 41 dave osborne and i think he picked up a first down as he took it all the way to,0
the los angeles 48 guy here obviously that s the type play that minnesota would like to run because theyre doing a couple of things,0
theyre keeping that ball there moving and consistently in there not too far from field goal range another first down or so you put that,0
thing up in the air on a day like today anything can happen in the round for notorious birth interception they either lead the league,0
each year or write among the top of their interceptions because their defenses are so well coordinated vikings have 10 first down to the ball,0
game so far bill brown 45 down at the 44 david jones deacon dont attack they johnny cash johnny cash oh wednesday night at 9:00,0
8:00 central time here on abc is guess louis armstrong and tennessee ernie ford did i say anymore the johnny cash show coming up on,0
abc wednesday night at 9:00 eastern time second down seven baller 444 minnesota owns it los angeles territory theyll brown again fellow rams have got,0
it minnesota in the car the jean washington the wide receiver came back and got the football and pepsi williams had it for a split,0
second so the vikings fumbled their way to a first down that time ball will be put down at the los angeles 36 grain helped,0
him down rain throughout the game plazo osborn he s having a good night dave osborne bouncing inside the 30 to the 28 yard line,0
so when they ran that play donald right through the deacon in maryland yeah we havent heard much from the jig tonight that they were,0
deacon was telling me he s a little concerned because last week they went outside him he says im gonna be playing for that because,0
they spelled that film theyre gonna try to come outside me well he did again right then but this is the kind of feel again,0
it s not the best kind of feel for deacon to play on he relies on his fitness or they does his strength ours 118,0
carries 53 yards second down long three bill brown full power straight ahead close to the first down you know the kid old bill brown,0
here in minnesota about being so bowlegged in this to me the program is 5 foot 11 he says you know if i get my,0
leg straighten out i be six foot four like fullbacks are supposed to be he does pretty good at 5 foot 11 you know fellas,0

saturday third down along seven yards for minnesota wallace on the los angeles 23 and we have gone through 3/4 at the end of the,0
third period our score lead the minnesota vikings 10th the los angeles rams three we are ready to go to the final 15 minutes of,0
this premiere contest between the los angeles rams and the minnesota viking the vikings are leading by a score of 10 to 3 they own,0
the football they have had 47 offensive plays in this game compared to 31 for the raft after 3 quarters the ball is down at,0
the los angeles 23 yard line 3rd down and 7 a single touchdown separating these two giants in professional football a big play here for,0
minnesota darryl brown straight ahead power he s down to about the 18 itll be short of the first down theyve got to go to,0
the 16 to get it it s going to bring up fourth down and fred cox is coming on the field the field goal unit,0
for minnesota so fred cox who is total 55 points so far in this season is on the field all krauss the free safety is,0
the man who holds for it he is kicked sick 13 field goals and 16 extra points this year it s from the 26 yard,0
line in front and we have a timeout here at the follow the stadium bloomington minnesota with the minnesota vikings now leading the los angeles,0
rams 13 fred cox will kick off for the minnesota vikings and you can clearly see how hard the rain is falling here in wilmington,0
minnesota the vikings getting the points albert heyman deep when you come down field youre in position always get your points both coaches preach that,0
george allen for the rams but grant for minnesota alvin heyman number 23 from the fiveyard line he is back to the 25 and he,0
loses his footing a penalty flag on the field or is it let s see alvin heyman who had averaged 33 yards per kick off,0
return one of the most exciting performers in the game this year they will bring it back apparently and wreak ich so while were waiting,0
for the ball to be placed take a look at the third quarter statistics or the stats through the third quarter they will move it,0
back to the 35 yard line where the minnesota vikings will wreak ich and our do you have any more information about the fight well,0
get to that just a moment but the bikes did exactly what they wanted in their last drive they consumed six minutes and ten seconds,0
ten claims for 58 yards ball control is there back fourth round fight stop muhammad ali the winner jerry quarry cut over the eye youll,0
see it next saturday on abc s wide world of sports alvin heyman again the deep man for the los angeles rams vikings illegal procedure,0
will kick off from their 35 1406 to go in the ball game the vikings leading 13 to 3 cox hits it it s high,0
and it may go out of bounds squibs and heyman lets it alone and it does trickle out of bounds so minnesota will kick it,0
again and they will probably kick it from the 30yard line that can hurt minnesota on a situation like this when you have to kick,0
the ball over again it s been pointed out or it s been proved out i guess in the past that a lot of big,0
plays occur after you kick once and come back and kick again for one reason or another the guys are maybe let down a little,0
bit on that second attempt this time we have the third attempt so it possibly could make a difference bud grant talking to his kicker,0
fred cox the vikings getting seven in the first quarter three in the second quarter the rams got on the board with a field goal,0
in the third quarter the vikings have added three here in the fourth quarter they lead 13 to 3 and we have 13 58 to,0
play in the game in mesquite one out earlier we have old dan august up here in the press box with us and it s,0
kind of a nice feeling on a rainy day like this that s your own policeman a nice looking clean good kid the night just,0

back up there watching this thing he s nice and dry then our two series of course on abc here spread this time fred gets,0
all of it hits it good and it goes down to the 10 yard line and it is willie ellison bringing it back to the,0
29 yard line well they got out of that all right done now they really know was the third kick but there is the flag,0
on the play they have to kick this one over you think were kicking from the goal line in a little while and it s,0
been really hard no this is just a fourth you know other folks must have been piling on very quickly on that fight tony perez,0
was the referee he stopped the fight between rounds the cut apparently extremely severe jerry quarry violently charged into the rain so of a personal,0
foul penalty puts the ball up at the 44 yard line first down los angeles at the rams 44 roman gabriel is the quarterback and,0
gave back to throw he looks and throws deep it may be intercepted in his picked off by paul the intended receiver objection oh made,0
the pack on the tab got away from gabriel he threw it well over the head of the intended receiver and the vikings have intercepted,0
gabriel for the fourth time tonight minnesota s ball first then ten at their own 15 as this replay comes up done you never panic,0
in the face of his own do you well you really should just overthrown a little bit and kraus is back there that s his,0
job they call him the centerfielder a football and he s really done that well he stays on his pace that he s been in,0
the last few years in football he s going to break all character records and pass interception paul krauss number 22 gary croisé oh the,0
minnesota quarterback the running backs are osborne and brown theyve been doing the bulk of the work here tonight and the play again hammers into,0
the middle with bill brown number 30 carrying and he got a yard coming up this saturday ncaa college football on abc regional action california,0

listings for the game in your area second down and nine for the vikings from their own 16 yard line pazzo gives it the dave,0
osborne and dave is dropped right about the line of scrimmage myron patios number 66 anchored him i remember now what i was thinking about,0
myself that paul krause he s played seven years of pro football has 43 that last one being 44 interception and it says that he,0
maintains that interception pace he could break the nfl career mark which is seventy nine interceptions by emmalin finnell dave osborne scary twenty times in,0
the game 54 yards bill brown 15 times for 50 yards of course bill brown has a game ball tucked away because he has tonight,0
passed the five thousand yard mark 13th man nfl history to do it it s third down eight yards to go for the minnesota vikings,0
theyve ours run with the ball slipping over the right side he s up for close to the first down but short of it eddy,0
matter number 21 made the tackle along with ritchie pettibone and so the punting team comes on the field tom mcneil number 12 the man,0
who will kick it jim lindsey number 21 come running on the field with the kicking team and miss lindsey has made three sharp tackles,0
tonight one of them saved a touchdown at the conclusion of the first half when the rams were denied at the goal line mcniel gets,0
it away with pressure alvin hammond backing up on a good kick bum of the ball vikings may have it lee the rams got it,0
that was a good alert play permit alexander number 39 alexander the man who slid under and picked it off for the rams we have,0
a timeout here in bloomington minnesota our score in the fourth quarter vikings 13 rams 3 next monday night on abc from pittsburgh three rivers,0
stadium cincinnati bengals and the pittsburgh steelers right now we watched the los angeles rams first down from their own 32 yard line vikings 13,0
rams 3 in the handoff to tommy laysan a former viking and tommy is up to the 37 yard line before tommy s got a,0
great career football has been hampered a lot by injuries he was actually the first minnesota viking drafted out of the can of the college,0
ranks at lsu is this had a splendid career here at minnesota and has done a very good job los angeles josephson shifting off the,0
eye gabriel gives it again to tommy mason and tom is up close to the 44 yard line and that will be a los angeles,0
first down wally hildenburg number 58 jim marshall number 70 defensively for minnesota patients actually from tulane not lsu i went to smu he didnt,0
go there the amount of green green easy yeah im sorry through lane fan im sorry he also plays the guitar he cant be all,0
that bad when stan ran that there on 44 roman gabriel who had a bloody nose had to leave the game back in still the,0
same sturdy oak of a quarterback he s always been leicester josephson slowed up humble rams would go to the ball it jumped right into,0
the hands of charlie cowen number 73 can you imagine what a shock that is the count is he turns around his block sees that,0
ball float right in his hand they picked up five yards on their sixth fumble theyve lost three you know get that much rain los,0
angeles well jack teal said before the game started weve come to minnesota now and the last three times it s been snow snow and,0
rain second down and six of all is at the 47 yard line 48 yard line tommy mason trying to follow charlie cowen he gets,0
it up close to midfield alan no it s gary larson number 77 call it midfield theyve got to go to the minnesota 46 just,0
inside the fort is sick to get the first down itll be third down along for bob long number 86 coming why but the right,0
checks no is wide to the left gave asking for the towel everything is wet wouldnt mean gabriel now 8:14 passing 52 yards back to,0
throw here looking he s gonna run it gilligan burn number eightyeight had done it that minnesota secondary has done quite a job tonight i,0
dont really know how fast ellen page is on a 40yard dash but roman gabriel runs about a five plant and youll see pate he,0
s playing off his block he sees romans going out of the backfield here he takes it off he had to run 40 yards and,0
they look at that stride romans not slow they called him down there fourth down and a yard board around les joseph son he s,0
got the first down at the minnesota 44 done just mentioned the tate s didnt even have to run 40 yards and he mentioned gabriel,0
is running the 40 yard sprint in five flat actually george allen is different for most coaches he doesnt have his play as sprint he,0
fears that sprint s produced muscle bones he has them do the 40 yard stride but football is a 40 yard game and that s,0
why they use the 40 yard measurement well explain that more fully later kennyman snaps to roman gabriel gave back to throw throws to the,0
sideline pass it incomplete as bob bryant came over hit jack snow at the same time the ball arrived and it drops out about there,0
s two things to let s take a look at roman number one when the fall is as wet as it is and heavy youll,0
see roman throw a little bit different you see snow run up these kind of shot putting that ball a little bit you cant get,0
nearly the zip on it as you cant when you got a good dry ball that ball hit snow kind of round right in the,0
numbers but he took a little bump from the back by bob bright and completed fast well try it again second down ten rams ball,0
minnesota 44 bass is intended for bob long ad shakman right there i guess the strongest thing about a zone youll see all those purple,0
shirts back in then they got seven people back there they believe in that front fold they let them rush the faster that did put,0
the pressure on roman and he s theyve been doing that very well they go back into these areas they can drop those linebackers back,0
is deep well much deeper then let s say if they were covering on a mantoman situation it makes it difficult to actually find a,0
guy that s gonna be wide open you got to dip that ball and when you cant zip it it calls them one reason another,0
it does cause you some problems middle linebacker lonnie warwick had also dropped off and he actually had a fairly good chance at intercepting third,0
down ten rams minnesota 44 keep hit by marshall which is one of the redeeming qualities of it tommy mason the man closest to it,0
and wally hildenburg really zinged him but the past is no good i will take lick from the slomo romans making a slight fake in,0
there he s actually gonna roll it looked like had good pressure from the outside by larsen and paige you see the other big boys,0
coming in ellerth the morenae one as he came in just never had a chance to set up and throw fourth down and ten los,0
angeles from the minnesota 44 and david ray number 27 is in number 70 is mitch johnson number 80 is bob klein johnson to tackle,0
and klein atty it in there in the block ritchie pettibone number 17 is going to put it down and david ray is gonna bite,0
himself off quite a chunk here because he is going to try a field goal from the los angeles and i want to give him,0
the benefit of the doubt and say the 48 yard line will be 52 yards it s faith pettibone up with it former quarterback from,0
tulane friday well short of the first down minnesota takes over first in town at their own 41 and carl eller was the man who,0

nebraska colorado south carolina georgia holy cross buffalo capote your local listings for the pamela game in your area and those in the east schedule,0

stop the path and his intended receiver window sucker downfield fell down and gave just unloaded well los angeles has field position now keith and,0
theyve got to start to make the move because early as it is and although there s a long way to go and anything can,0
happen as they always say there s no toughest team to play catchup football against in the minnesota vikings id like to amplify what i,0
said earlier mr reed the owner of the rams is reported to it that allen will not be back as coach even if they win,0
the super bowl the distinction between a reported to us bed and actually hearing the state isnt that the truth second thousand dead inside handoff,0
and the letter really snapped on that one number 88 alan page was the first man that gets to the ball carrier along with gary,0
larson who split across you see alan page number 88 he made a great move to the inside actually nobody touched him and a guy,0
that big maybe look like a very simple move but now there s not very many folks that can make that kind of move so,0
he s a difficult man to block zone and he s certainly a problem for any offensive team but if youre gonna run up the,0
middle larry smith has two yards third down eight from the 40 for the rams viking bleeding ten nothing heller gets back maybe you did,0
penalty flags it down gabriel looking for someone to throw to and cannot get rid of it and again if alan page number 88 knocking,0
the los angeles quarterback down while we await the penalty done im surprised that the trouble gabe is having getting rid of the ball because,0
one would have expected him based on the game plan he disclosed to us to throw quickly to his back flaring out ought to his,0
tight in and he looked he was looking defense yeah he said that he thought he would start with a three pass powered babied i,0
kind of leaned the model a bit and see what they do the the viking do runners own do the strong side in the weak,0
side so maybe he s checking him out some way they didnt tell us about 5yard offside minnesota moves the ball with a 45yard line,0
rams third down theyve got to go just over the 48 to get the first down about three and a half yards on third down,0
for gabriel 12 in the flow again he s having trouble finding people he can ask jim marshall knock him down the football is lewis,0
but the rams retain possession so the old pigskin is pretty slick tonight and down in the bottom ken im a number 50 the man,0
that came up for the ball and get this for los angeles that tells you something about the efficiency of the minnesota secondary that s,0
two times in a row gabriel just simply couldnt find anybody to throw to the ball is back at the 39 yard line on fourth,0
and nine that scottsdale is in the front the deep manner bob grimm and charlie west for the minnesota vikings and such still kick a,0
low liner goes to west he picked it at the 26 27 yard line he comes back about two yards before his feet are jerked,0
out from under him by bob client at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota we have a timeout with 636 to play in the first half,0
of the score the minnesota vikings 10 the los angeles rams nothing this is ford maverick the simple machines symbols our own drive and service,0
and this is one of the strongest quietest fords ever built the 1971 ford ltd but small cars arent big enough for some people and,0
others dont need a large car so ford has something right in the middle you should know about so we know if you like small,0
car prices and the 40 away small cars handle but you dont want to give up the smoother ride of a big car or room,0
for six remember boards got something right in the middle tory knows and you can take your choice of sedan wagon sports roofs hard tops,0
even a convertible when you want some of the things from a small car and some of the things from a big car you want,0
something right in the middle tory know all 14 models are available at your ford dealers now gives you better idea the minnesota vikings own,0
the football with 636 to go in the first half the ball is at their own 29 yard line first down gary croisé oh with,0
osborne and brown behind it and it s osborne flipping through and again he got great blocking from the left side of the line he,0
comes all the way out to the 48 yard line before kermit alexander and eddie a minute makes the tackle for the rams 11 yards,0
on the play right here let s pause five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves the minnesota vikings now have nine first,0
down one for the rams the vikings lead ten nothing second quarter six minutes to play in the first half pazzo gives it to dave,0
osborne and osborne is dragged down back at the 37 yard line and dyer on talbert number 72 back around the minnesota vikings grab the,0
lead in the first quarter capitalizing on a los angeles fumble took it in from the 18 yard line a scoring strike from kwas go,0
to brown of 17 yards and then fred tuck has kicked the 13 yard field goal and the vikings have a pin nothing leads with,0
525 to go in the birthday second down and 14 back at the 36 rams defense dancing around 43 yard line for the minnesota vikings,0
this time it s eddy matter coming out of the secondary with help from roy bacon on the fact they think a pretty good shot,0
at the newest members of that fearsome foursome and toy bacon and darent albert over there and this is not unusual this is a kind,0
of expected thing it seems like guy if you find a new face in the lineup that s what you want to do is check,0
him out not that these guys are that new but you certainly heard a little bit more of deacon jones and merlin olsen when they,0
continue that you just have to wait complete ball is at the 43 third down seven minnesota theyve got to go to midfield to get,0
the first down whoa he s on the sneak he gets to the 46 and that s all number 66 myron patios middle linebackers stop,0
so oh dont have to kick it away play the torch is done i dont know what that is that s not like the quarterbacks,0
i know he called a quarterback sneak on third meet tom mcneal number 12 is in the front as gary pazzo goes to the sidelines,0
like neela kick flat for a 38 yard average under his normal average the deep man is alvin haman haman back at the 18 flipsie,0
slides and finally found he goes alvin heyman is brought down by dale heck bart number 49 weve seen a little pilfering and a little,0
see bri out here on the field so far in this first half and it s probably a good thing to have burt reynolds with,0
us tonight as detective ban august and youll see in first shot and he looses lawbreaker wednesday night of 10:00 9:00 central time on abc,0
he s my favorite police rams ball first down 26 yard line vikings lead 10 nothing let s see what the rams can do they,0
can get it going gabriel gives it to lester josephson and the big youngster from mineola minnesota comes up and gets no more than to,0
wear down the 315 left to play in the half keith and it reminds me of the situation a year ago when los angeles los,0
angeles had everything going for it in the first half and white against minnesota in the western conference title game 17 to 7 at halftime,0
now the 10 point differential favors minnesota give him one yard on the previous play make it second down and nine from the 27th gabriel,0
stays with a running game karl eller number 81 in marshal number 70 on the defensive play for the minnesota vikings i know romans aware,0
of this we talked about it before the ballgame as he pointed out there s the worst thing you can do against the zone defense,0
team is to force yourself or you force your passing game into the zone because we suddenly talk about the zone many times these people,0
are covering areas out here and it seems that he s been a little pressured for some races but of course his pattern you may,0
see him come back with it later and pick out the short one third down and seven from the 29 gabriel back to throw nobody,0
to throw soo he finally unloads it to lester josephson it is short and incomplete jim marshall was the man really putting the heat on,0
gabriel and forced him finally if you unloaded well let s so we have a minute 57 to play in the first half nfl monday,0
night football will continue from metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota with our score the vikings pan iran cutting what are you giving your wife for,0

for los angeles on for spin 7 charlie west and bob grim mar deep that doesnt get all of it it s a high kick,0
but quite short and it takes the viking bounce and comes back up to you to the 48 yard line and there minnesota will have,0
it first and then the vikings have dominated the first half coming up at halftime howard cosell well have highlights of nfl action for you,0
the balance kansas city game detroit chicago green bay philadelphia and the new york giants big win over the st louis cardinals that s dutch,0
still getting only 23 yards on that fun know what you guys gonna talk to those cowboys last week gary kwas oh that s the,0
trigger for the vikings back to throw he had a moment and then suddenly that moment was gone as the ram penetrated merlin olsen and,0
died on calvary s it kind of feel that when all these guys come bouncing in there and theyve comes one here comes another one,0
i took dennis back here with that football he s an orthodontist that way it was funny it s number one in his class interesting,0
though story wonder why i want to be in it is an orthodontist is that right dean ssi and his comment was that he wanted,0
people who come to him when he werent in pain well that was kind of an interesting little with a reason to be an orthodontist,0
on second down and 18 and off goes to bill brown in the middle and there is no room for mr brown this time as,0
myron patios number 66 and deacon jones number 75 the ball is now back at the minnesota 39 this series started up fa 48 so,0
it is going to be third down and 19 jim nettles number 19 just checked into the ram secondary replacing myron adios on the third,0
and 19 so obviously the rams expect pass marzo gives us the bill brown and brown fighting to get loose is tripped by jack pardee,0
who s quite a football story and so itll be fourth down and about 23 yards to go and there s the time remaining in,0
the first half the vikings fans are nothing leads and they have thoroughly dominated this first half of play americans in all are aware of,0

ellison may have gotten a piece of it it s a very short kick coming alexander on the sidelines you may go all the way,0
he is down ken lindsay dragged him down at the 2 yard line for minnesota quickly noodle things turn around we see accented of a,0
39 and alexander was a running back in college so he knows what to do with that fall when he gets it makes a good,0
move down the sideline his hip great save there just to bring him down just running the goal i was different ramp together then they,0
can turn this thing around in the second half the ball is on the minnesota two yard line first and goal to go los angeles,0
a 49 yard return of that partially deflected and i believe it was partially deflected by ellison number 33 19 seconds remain to play in,0
the first half roman gabriel signed to cash in on this big opportunity for los angeles lester joseph in the sound of the goal line,0
but he is not in time called by los angeles 11 seconds to play in the first half what a turn of events that you,0
said what a break for los angeles when most it needed it we talked before about george ellen one of his most daring raids took,0
place in the last offseason when he finished waist taking cyclist bruce kasich up to san francisco for permit alexander an elected to go where,0
the youngsters came up to the big time as a wide receiver named david ray ray came through in the clutch situation against green bay,0
last week to break at twenty one to twenty one tie alexander is evidencing his values tonight in the allen theory is i respect specialists,0
but if i can get a man who s the total athlete i want it under crisis conditions hell react the way a total athlete,0
should and the place take a 111 seconds left to play as you see in this the first tab at the rams can get this,0
over well it s a threepoint differential and edge everyone would say a brand new ball both side ends to action client are in the,0
ballgame now go from about two feet away gabriel quarterback sneak he did not make it good but it looks like he is calling him,0
fallacy that hold everything whether or not the rams were able to call time before tannic fire the indication apparently is that gabriel on the,0
quarterback sneak kid managed to call time before time expired wally hildenburg and gary larson were already off the field but gabriel keeping the ball,0
on the quarterback sneak immediately call time when he heard the whistle gabriel tries again he did not make it oh my we have come,0

halftime score 10 to nothing and this was the final play of the half with the vikings leading by that 10 to nothing count roman,0
gabriel over his center kenny ayman for the second time in a row virtually at the goal line the quarterback keeper for the second time,0
in her own not getting past the purple gang and the frustration will probably live with the rams throughout the half time period what a,0
job for a coach to get a team back up after that kind of disappointment three shots they had from inside the three yard line,0
they couldnt put it across after the great base break on the punt return by kermit alexander 10 to nothing minnesota now as is our,0
usual procedure at halftime every monday night through the courtesy of nfl films the highlights of some of the key games of the recent weekend,0
and so let s pick up with that pregame festivities at kansas city the super chiefs about to take on the dallas cowboys it s,0
early in the first quarter first time the team cap the ball they were top of the towers fumble on the dallas 31 ronnie johnson,0
hits number 30 gloucester richardson who goes out on the dallas by quickly then the chiefs are ready to assume an early lead and just,0
three plays later the handoff goes to ed photo a count of highlights we prime in behind good blocking by mo mormon and the chief,0
with the conversion have a seven to nothing lead over by cowboy total actually coming a more consequential figure in kansas city scheme of things,0
since the craving of mike garrett to san diego but now were in the third quarter and dallas is leading 13 to 10 doctor what,0
s the number 18 i noticed ella but finds instead bro listing a deception dallas has field position on the t47 does two plays later,0
galvan hill sidelines with back problems wayne thomas becomes four were caught number 33 watch him gulf all the way in for the touchdown dallas,0
seems a commanding lead at 22 pitch that young man has this tremendous potential lane dumbest now this is the next time the cowboys have,0
possession of clean pass when craig morton to blame thomas again on the quotes down the sideline and nobody s going to get him this,0
time either an apparent touchdown 72 yard play but only apparent cowboys detected holding the ball call back this could be the term orton this,0
just two plays later craig finds the incomparable steve kerr the former olympic champion bob age who has no trouble out racing pemex dumbest this,0
was a game that gala commanded kansas city mustard too late a field goal the final score dallas 27 and to city 16 and bob,0
hayes in the doghouse earlier this year is very much out of it now now this is detroit at chicago wrigley field the two met,0
earlier and a game covered by abc and this one began the same way as the earlier one with shanshan only for in finding dick,0
40 new people and barney for the third time this year and quickly the bears have a surprising 7 to nothing lead but as that,0
momentum it seemed in the first half detroit mustered a field goal now with the saw seven afraid concannon fine george palmer and that s,0
number 20 when barney beaten again rama goes all the way down to the 4 yard line of the lions bears being ready to take,0
full control of the ballgame but you see the fumble recovered by the lions and so the first half ended their 7 the lions great,0

right to l mcculloch a fleet footed wide receiver the board foot olympic in order to play professional football throwing a bruising game destroyed hung,0
on for a 1616 victory both of unexpected but still a victory now were back live at metropolitan stadium in bloomington minnesota the vikings enjoying,0

43 yards first down los angeles roman gabriel is the quarterback and gabe goes right back to throw he swings it out the leicester josephson,0

and jordyn is knocked out of bounds by paul fast number 22 at the viking 42 yard line incredible away he s come back from,0
that rusted achilles tendon operation especially as relatively advanced years that may be the most difficult of all injuries to come back you know anybody,0
well if he s a real nice guy very happy to see him back running in a good bit farming here showed you picked up,0
20 yards on the play call up the 43 yard line first down los angeles in minnesota country gabriel still got it i dont know,0
how to ready to scrap what happening any better than maybe you can describe it at home but really and truly it just seems like,0
everything the rims trying to do they theyre just not the right place and that was a playaction pass it didnt clear out to lee,0
as well as simply i can pass the hood now roman you see roman on the sidelines he did get a pretty good shot there,0
to the nose making some nose they drew that that one will come back karl sweep in is the new quarterback take a look at,0
him we ten number ten the ball is now back at the los angeles 49 yard line second down and 21 they give it away,0
to larry smith that s miss trying to get around the corner cannot turn that corner as a minnesota defense reacts very well lonnie warwick,0
number 59 knocked him out of bounds karl sweep at number 10 i know george allen has a great deal of confidence in sweep then,0
he has been around the league at a few clubs before he made the ram stop but he seems to give them the type strength,0
they need he s a great support man far roman roamin very seldom get hurt get hurt but when he does they have some confidence,0
in sweet man third down and about 17 yards to go the handoff is inside on a set play and it doesnt work for much,0
as larry smith gets through about to minnesota 46 yard line they had to go down to the 33 to get their first down so,0
they los angeles rams have a decision here for the ball resting at the minnesota 47 yard line roman gabriel has been sacked three times,0
tonight for a total of 18 yards and with a weather conditions being what they are the rams will punt the deep men charlie westen,0
bob graham and pat stud still will hit it from about his own 42 yard line that on four fronts from the first half average,0
33 and a half yards fell under his normal season average the kick is away this is pretty good when charlie west looks at it,0
it bounces on down and it is about to be marked down at about the 5yard line just outside the five as the rams put,0
it down and we have a timeout here at metropolitan stadium in minnesota with a minnesota vikings leading the los angeles rams past or defending,0
my wife start the car funny either windshield wipers radio then after the battery gets a good workout she starts the car if you have,0
a wife like line you better have a sears diehard battery but i hide with extra starting power to start your car when most batteries,0

me closing with more copper to now you got it gillette platinum plus other than stainless more durable than chrome for the cave youve always,0
wanted and more to that platinum plus that s my blade that was very good john see didnt need the football players number eighteen standing,0
on the sidelines and white there if roman gabriel the los angeles rams quarterback he s been sacked three times for loss of eighteen yards,0
but do you know perhaps the injury could be greater well wait and see meantime minnesota has it first down on their own 6yard line,0
and plazo gives to dave osborne and osbourne left it up to about the eight yard line before maxi bond the outside linebacker and ritchie,0
pettibone makes the tackle for the round a quarterback standpoint i really think this is probably the worst kind of weather that you can have,0
to play in it primarily because it does affect everybody and it affects all phases of the game when the ball is wet and slippery,0
you cant handle it that well your receivers are not gonna hold on to it your runners cant get good footage so it s really,0
a it s not a good night now before we have it for this that s a ballgame second down make it a three yard,0
advance for osborne second down and seven the handoff goes to bill brown and bill is across the 10 up to about the 11 before,0
he s knocked off his pen running in behind ed white and grady alderman and our own talbert made the tackle offense in the vein,0
that john just touched upon we had six fumbles in the first half for by los angeles the rams lost three of them two by,0
the vikings they lost both you cant really panic in a situation like this but i know the vikings are thinking about we cant again,0
afford to do anything that would cause these fumbles for interceptions well theyve got to kind of play it cautious ten fifteen to go third,0
quarter vikings lead ten nothing long count dave osborne dropped up the pin yardline david jones beacon drones and maxi ball another chance now with,0
this forthcoming front for the los angeles rams to get good field position but remember the rams at the moment without roman gabriel out for,0
the bloodied nose helmets gone off his head by a fire in roman of course the player of the year in the nfl a year,0
ago so a critical commodity to this randy number 12 tom mcneil will punt for minnesota averaged 28 yards on four kicks in the first,0
half rain continues to come down on the soggy night hipster lowdriving kick cayman backs up takes it falls down after los angeles 49 but,0
he gets up almost looks around the corner and he has finally dragged down as the vikings recover and enough of them get ahold of,0
him to knock him off his fans milk sunday number 64 the man who knocked him out let s take a look at this on,0
us again when the field is not in a real good flank and issues youll see him fall down this throws off the timing of,0
everybody so the defensive men that are coming down cant seem to get a good move on heyman is a great kick return man got,0
your team doing the dance on the side that reminds me the dick you do dance came across this great field position and he gained,0
14 yards a fixall 14 on the run back timeout minnesota the score viking fan rams nothing yeah i gave great performance out of it,0

doesnt hurt mccutchen at aqaba well it s a great dance big plus the lowest led highest octane gasoline for the money it s not,0
going to land automotive emissions by itself but these customers tell us at the nice dock well thank you lapham first down at the minnesota,0
36 yard line as a result of festering by alvin hammond roman gabriel is back in the ball game he s been repaired and gabriel,0
is back to throw flips and delivers it is complete for the pie damn billy to action he has dropped at the 31 by lonnie,0
warwick middle linebacker that s what he s going to have to do more in laura dont do a great done quick pops yeah i,0
think you will he s got a that is something that s consistent and relaxed has not been used tonight he is a good receiver,0
can has been a consistency before the ramp roman is back in there romans their leader and as they say leaders are lonely but they,0
lead a good life theyve got to have roman back in there he s got enough space for leadership second down five los angeles at,0
the minnesota 31 lester josephson second effort gets into the twenty nine be paid and mr mark emergency were there you get back that puddle,0
you hook around a train coming down all over you you see somebody likes minnesota backing runyan you look back in your manual a what,0
have i got in my game plan well you know your game plan has been hampered by the weather because youre not gonna be able,0
to do as many things effectively so you got to think how can i do it well and consistent you got to go to the,0
things that you leave in little rock turn in maybe a three path third down three yards to go for the round at the minnesota,0
twentynine gabriel to throw he dumped at the larry smith smith falls down at the 30 gift up gifts one yard to the 28th maybe,0
the 27 he is short of the first down was i really pull in for anybody up here but you know i hate to see,0
you as least this caliber really be hampered like this and that was a great screen that was set up for the right side and,0
it s miss lady s turn the putting different asunder and i dont know where they made it first down or not theyve got to,0
do things like that s a keep these drives going well they had to go through the 26 yard line to get the first down,0
from our angle i would say the ball is short by at least a half a yard but let s wait and see as the,0
pain game comes on seven minutes and 29 seconds to play in the third quarter the vikings are leading tender nothing and it s more,0
like a full yard short is sec another look at the plan his hero when he s gonna set up this dream pass and what,0
he s trying to do corsets make it look just like a pass down still made a quick step there was missed in the 38,0
after secondary he just couldnt stay up on his feet number 16 the rams will go for it david ray is not in the ball,0
game on fourth down and one from the 27 the ram trailing 10 nothing frustrated in this rainy night and on the soggy field against,0
the powerful vikings will try for the first down gabriel has it throws it is caught by belly relax invented to accept out of bounds,0
janet a minnesota 16 yard line as john meredith knows that was a great and gutsy call and they learned their lesson trying for the,0
short yardage against that purple gang earlier at the end of the last half i think this is really one of the most entertaining things,0
in football got you it s the fourth down it s a big game i like to see folks call plays like this through accident,0
it s put it all out on the line is what it s doing through that does get things rollin did his thing so well,0
see what happens first down for the ram their third first down of the ballgame first down at the minnesota 16 miss johnson number 70,0
in a second gabriel dumps it to larry smith and smith is not that amount by roy winston number 16 who s backed into the,0
play and then coming out of the secondary after looping around the middle linebacker lonnie warwick will look this from the endzone youll see again,0
this is a very similar play that we looked at while ago again rolling sets up but again you see his offensive line sweep out,0
to the right to set up in front of larry smith this time he catches it and instead of cutting back you dont try to,0
go around winston does make a good move plays off a block comes in milk a brand number 89 also did a good job of,0
closing that screen play off not gonna get anything cheap on these vikings there well still theyre good football players give him one yard short,0
yard make it second down and nine from about the 15 tommy mason in the backfield for los angeles after the endzone intended for jack,0
snow is in the complete bobby black was right there roman gabriel now eight out of 12 for 52 yards in his passing you know,0
when you have a broken nose and i have about eight or ten of those things and people use a see how much do they,0
affect you they dont affect you that much of course unless there s a lot of swelling which does occur sometimes with a broken ocean,0
you cant see it impairs your vision but theyre painful and it s real cold out there which is not really that cold and i,0
didnt make sure that little bit more difficult for the breed bob long is wide to the left no flip to the right matrix white,0
shirt in the back field for the los angeles rams on third down and nine gabriel to throw got this passed away into the end,0
zone the intended receiver was jack crow he flipped and was held up by bobby bryant a fascism completed his fourth down and now we,0
get david ray number 27 in for the field goal fries david ray starting tonight at a total of 49 points in scoring the leading,0
scorer for the los angeles rams fred cox has now moved into the lead in the national football conference with a total of 55 including,0
the points tonight earl mann detroit as 53 and if david ray is successful from the 23 yard line he will have 52 richie pettibone,0
number 17 is gonna hold ritchie s former quarterback finally angle from the right hash mark or molested you look at it and david ray,0
who kicked the pressurepacked field goal last week for the rams is straight for the middle a play 36 yards we have a timeout here,0
in minnesota with a for now the minnesota vikings fans the los angeles rams three introducing the world s second 747 ii the only 747,0
that doesnt fly at $7 and 47 times a day then for seven dollars and forty seven cents a day for ten cents a mile,0
in gas we rent to afford for a week a weekend or a holiday if the boeing 747 is revolutionising traveled in the air who,0
knows the hurt 747 may do it with a ford on the ground let jones charlie west or deep for the minnesota vikings as david,0
raised sets the kickoff for the los angeles rams the rams getting on the board at 9:05 gone in the third quarter and the score,0
is now 10 to 3 the rains still melting down and ray hits it well knock this down to the oneyard line with what jim,0
picks it up look out he s got hold and the last man the very muddy shirt underneath him though and let s give some,0
credit to alvin haman number 23 you see jones he s got great acceleration he s a big back he s following that front pour,0
up their poem he s trying to split the scenes which he does right here again i think the field conditions dictate a run like,0
this because you get kent cut real well he just ran right straight ahead and david ray was the last man and he brought it,0
back 41 yards gary quadro the quarterback bill brown and dale osborne are the running backs the baby balls for minnesota osborne a beautiful hole,0
and mario gets the job done that s a 45 yard line the game from the 42 make it three yards second down seven coming,0
up the development of 20 owns has been one of the happy things for the minnesota vikings he came out of michigan state as you,0
all know a heralded football player but didnt come on in his first couple of years now he is a key figure in that minnesota,0
attack realizing upon all the potential he had at michigan state second down seven plazo back to frog throws it is incomplete hit a los,0
angeles lamb over there the past is intended for osborn and hed washington lays back the spirit slips through there maxie pond got a hand,0
take a look you read any luck this time he had that one back maxi bombs very experienced number 55 youll see you hit max,0
youve counted right in the hand but get it upsetting but grant didnt like that either otto magnus mr sponge on himself out here this,0
plane today pazzo now five four nine 46 yards one touchdown third down 87 short seven flipping through the middle comes over 41 they have,0
osbourne and i think he picked up a first down as he took it all the way to the los angeles 48 yard line he,0
there that s the type play that i thought it would like to run because theyre doing a couple of things theyre keeping that far,0
theyre moving it consistently theyre not too far from steal gonna raise be another first batter so you put that thing up in the air,0
on a day like today anything can happen in the round for notorious birth interceptions they either lead the league easier right above the top,0
of there cause receivers are so well coordinated vikings have 10 first down to the ball game so far bill brown $45 for 44 david,0

point both coaches preach that george allen for the ram but grant for minnesota alvin heyman number 23 from the 5yard line to the 25,0
and he loses his footing a penalty flag on the field or is i see calvin haman who had averaged 33 yards per kick off,0
return one of the most exciting performers in the game this year they will bring it back apparently and wreak it so while were waiting,0
for the ball to be played to take a look at the third quarter statistics for the stats through the third quarter they will move,0
it back to the 35 yard line where the minnesota vikings will wreak ich kenne power do you have any more information about the fight,0

procedure will kick off from their 35 1406 to go in the ballgame the vikings leading 13 the free cockpit is high and it may,0
go out of bounds squib and heyman left it alone and it does stick a lot about so minnesota will kick it again and they,0
will probably kick it from the 30yard line i could hurt minnesota on a situation like this when you have to kick the fall over,0
again it s been pointed out or it s been proved out i guess in the past that a lot of big plays occur after,0
you kick once and jump back and kick again for one reason another the guys are maybe let down a little bit on that second,0
attempt this time we have a third attempt so it possibly could make a difference but grant talking through this kicker fred kocher the vikings,0
getting seven in the first quarter three in the second quarter the rams got on the board to the field goal in the third quarter,0
the vikings have added three here in the fourth quarter they lead 13 to 3 and we have 13 58 to play in the game,0

they really know what s the third tick but there is the flag on the play they have to kick get one over and there,0
anyway kicking from the goal line in a little bots it could really hurt so i bring in all the other folks must have been,0
piling on very quickly on that fight tony perez was the referee he stopped the fight between rounds the cut apparently extremely severe jerry quarry,0
violently dodged into the ring so the personal foul penalty puts the ball up at the 44 yard line first time los angeles that s,0
the ram 44 roman gabriel is the quarterback and gave back to throw he looks and throws deep it may be intercepted it is picked,0
off by whether it be reject oh the cab got away from gabriel he threw it well over the head of the intended receiver and,0
the vikings have intercepted gabriel for the fourth time tonight minnesota s ball first in ten at their own 15 as this replay comes up,0

a lot by injuries he was actually the first minnesota vikings drafted out of the gather the college ranks at lsu is a splendid career,0
here at minnesota and has done a very good job small sizes josephson shifting off the i gabriel gives it again to calm you mason,0
and tom is up close to the 44 yard line and that will be a los angeles first down wally hildenburg number 58 jim marshall,0

he s always been leicester josephson the rams go to the ball it jumped right into the hands of charlie cowen number 73 can you,0
imagine what a shock that is the count at the 33pound his box sees that ball float right in his hands they picked up five,0
yards on their sixth fumble theyve lost three you dont get that much rain los angeles well jack deal said before the game started weve,0
kind of minnesota now and the last three times it s been snow snow and rain second down and six the ball is at the,0
47 yard line 48 yard line tommy mason trying to follow charlie cowen he gets it up close to midfield alan nope is gary larson,0
number 77 call it misdeal theyve got to go to the minnesota 46 just inside the 46 to get the first down will be third,0
down along for bob long number 86 coming wide to the right deck snow is wide to the left gave asking for the powell everything,0
is wet with me gabriel now 8 to 14 passing 52 yards back to flow here looking he s gonna run it gilligan burn number,0
88 that done it that minnesota secondary has done quite a job tonight i dont really know how fast alan page is on the 40yard,0
dash but roman gabriel runs about a five flat and youll see page he s playing off his block he sees robust going out of,0
the backfield here he thinks though he had to run 40 yards and they look at that stride no one s not slow they called,0
him down there fourth down and a long yard board around less georgia fun he s got the first down at the better photo 44,0
done just mentioned the state didnt even have to run 40 yards and he mentioned gabriel is running the 40 yard sprint five flat actually,0
go down in a different for most coach if he doesnt have his players sprint he feels the sprint s produced muscle boat they have,0
some do the 40 yard drive but football is a 40 yard game and that s why they knew for 20odd measurement well iii meant,0
more fully later gentieman snaps to roman gabriel gave back the throw goes to the sideline passes incomplete as bob bryant came over his jax,0
know at the same time the ball arrives and it drops doubt about it there s two things to let s take a look at,0
roma number one when the fall is as wet as it is and heavy youll see roman so a little bit different you see snow,0
run up please kind of got foot in that ball a little bit you cant get nearly the zip on it if you can when,0
you got a good dry ball that ball hit snow counted in the smell right in the numbers but he took a little bump from,0
the backfire bob bright and completed fast will try it again second down 10 grams ball minnesota 44 fast is intended for bob long edgar,0
ockman right there i guess the strongest thing about of zone youll see our little purple shirts back you know they got seven people back,0
there they believe in that front four they let sim rush the faster they have to put the pressure on the roman and he s,0
theyve been doing that very well they go back into these areas they can drop those linebackers back as deep well much deeper then let,0
s say if they were covering on a mantoman situation it makes it difficult to actually find a guy that s gonna be wide open,0
you got a zip that fall and when you cant zip it because of one reason another it does cause you some problems middle linebacker,0
lonnie warwick had also dropped off and he actually had a fairly good chance at intercepting third down ten grand minnesota 44 gabe hits by,0
marco one of the redeeming qualities of him tony mason the man closest to it and wally hildenburg really zinged him but the past is,0
no good i would take a look from the slomo roman making a slight fake in there he s actually gonna roll and look like,0
had good pressure from the outside by larson and faze you see the other big boys coming in eller summer 81 if he came in,0
just never had a chance to set up and throw fourth down and 10 los angeles from the minnesota 44 and david ray number 27,0
is in number 70 is miss johnson number 80 is bob klein done for the tackle and flying to tie it in there in the,0
block richie pettibone number 17 is gonna put it down and david ray is gonna bite himself off quite a chunk here so he is,0
going to try a field goal from the los angeles i want to give him the benefit of a doubt and say the 48 yard,0

the way he described himself in his new book player of the year after losing the title game the minnesota a year ago this was,0

ball first down at the los angeles 27 the vikings use 2 minutes and 17 seconds in their last series so let s see how,0
much of the clock they can gobble up this time it s been a fine strong opportunist the game by minnesota george allen again disparate,0
it and you can understand it under the circumstances they use fumbles recovered them to their advantage they made the big players pass play for,0
a cd when they needed it theyve dominated brown and osborne of a setback proposed oh and it goes to bill brown and he just,0
jumped the middle of a live and there is the head man of the viking minnesota picked up 135 yards rushing so far in this,0

you see the totals on him he has 57 yards bill brown has carried 17 times for 55 yards and the playing conditions that you,0
can all say now judge dreadful has been terribly difficult all night john henderson wide receiver is back in the game vikings ball third down,0
and 12 from the 30yard line the play goes up the middle on third down it moves from the 30 up to the 26 obviously,0
short of the first down okay i think it s not an excellent job tonight in calling this this ballgame he s for only nine,0
times and please five of those go hand see but it s way you run your team out there has a lot to do with,0
how the rest of your ball club is gonna reacting and he s made some good calls he s kept the ball moving have eaten,0

suddenly from nowhere don the giants they have won six in a row but the eagles suddenly grown confident they have died the falcons in,0
their last game mister victory in a lastsecond field goal failure and they defeated miami before that and so we should have a great game,0
tonight because theyve always played the giants tough for further talk my colleague in a brand new winter coat for the occasion keith jackson oh,0
it s a cold night and it may have something to do with the outcome of the ballgame i think this is a case of,0
a football team philadelphia with nothing to lose and everything to gain a young ballclub that s been coming they are young at critical position,0
the linebacking positions in particular the new york giants on the other hand have a new kind of a pressure the pressure to keep on,0
winning and pursuit of st louis which is a fine football team so i think the ball game probably is on a hinge early in,0
the game as to whether or not the giants can move it and then philadelphia whether or not they can stop thank you keith the,0
quarterbacks as always from the gifted cornerback of yesteryear don meredith how i think that norman sneed the philadelphia quarterback i saw him in washington,0
and he came here as a rookie with the washing not only is the best rookie quarterback that ive ever seen he s been to,0
philadelphia now for several years he s not attained the height that im sure he had anticipated philadelphia s not attained that tide either he,0
is a very fine long ball floor he has been inconsistent he s still a lot of interceptions this is ben with the big claws,0
of the eagle offense this year their defense is ready you know the friend talking to the other side and fran is more confident right,0
now than ive ever seen it ive known friend for 15 years fran says theyre leading the offense a lot a lot of it up,0
to me and he likes it he s calling his plays ron johnson s going to big help to him and he think this is,0
a big help it s him he go to the odds of the defense of the philadelphia eagles and youve got a great linebacker core,0
that s going to give talking a lot of trouble he is aware of this he feels like he can do a good job tonight,0
so itll be up to the quarterbacks i think the other s game goes and of course youre looking at tim rossovich one of the,0
mod squad of the eagles converted out of southern california from defensive end the middle linebacker what s done was about dimension and you must,0
watch them closely tonight will brief you on them as the game develops and finally don also mentioned run gentle number 30 of the giants,0
probably the signal figure and the transformation of this team which was expected to do nothing but has become a contender accordingly i spoke to,0
ron moments ago ron i wonder if youd tell us the differences you see it between playing for cleveland a year ago and the giants,0
this year for in cleveland you had a team which was expected to win every week and i dont think that they were as high,0
as we are here in new york here in new york most of our games weve been underdogs and i think we have a lot,0
more spirit a lot more hustle and i think i enjoy this type of environment much better than the brown well you can feel that,0
every game is life and death any longer as you once said here in new york youve won six in a row but yes we,0
have howard but i think now teams are looking for the prestige of knocking off the new york giants and even playing a team like,0
philadelphia i think were going to have a rough time tonight almost incredibly you have the chance unprecedented ly in the history of the league,0
to lead in both past receptions and in rushing yardage now with this kind of overnight success what principle factor in your mind accounts for,0
well i think the main thing is getting a chance to play and being used and a type of situation where im used to being,0
used that in college and in high school i was more or less the principal offensive threat and i think this is the type of,0
situation where i am at my best final question what is talking to mentio success well i think our content has done a great job,0
during exhibition season when i wasnt starting he gave me a lot of confidence and told me to keep hustling and i would be starting,0
by the time the season did start and so far he s been using me quite a bit which i like and he s done,0
a heck of a good job calling plays and the physical things as far as running and passing your people believed in got a super,0
bowl yes or no yes sir till our very definitely good luck to you continued success thank you howard well be back in just one,0

he might have one after that play you know he hit him pretty hard got eaten in the opinion of fran talking is really when,0
the finest athletes theyve got on the team and he thinks hell make a big difference to their secondary now he s back in there,0
the basketball player they can college some faults got eaten slow but nobody moves fast a backwards which is what a cornerback often has to,0
do as you know down they get senders progress to the line of scrimmage 2nd down and 10 from the 46 and norms need to,0
throw the pressure by dyer and speed on load that is incomplete account it was intended for pender number 22 so it s going to,0
be third down in 10 for philadelphia from their 46 yard line interesting to note the development of dry had done now one of the,0
best pass rushes in the national football league still has things to learn but the help he s gotten from number 64 on the veteran,0
man hazeltine out of retirement is almost incredible hazeltine has been a bonanza to both the development of dryer and number 58 files the middle,0
linebacker dogs need oppa too and his passing came into the ballgame affection under 50% for the year third down and 10 from the 46,0
hell go again his passes away he has a man giri bowman who started in a wide receiver position he is hit by willie williams,0
but it s a first down philadelphia at the new york 35 you see gary ball would come out he goes was really a sideline,0
matter gary balm is over 85 snead does a slight roll to this side which puts more pressure on this defense they dont whether he,0
s going deep or not the ball was rolling good panning and willie williams over 41 is the man that you see it comes in,0
a very good tackles a great catch by fallen a gain of 18 yards on the play first now philadelphia new york just outside the,0
giant 35 larry watkins in the ball game number 34 setback replacing finding focus and bogus is down to the 30 yard line before number,0

based upon his past reception ability blocking ability and as you just saw running a villa followed a gain of six yards second down for,0
eagles ball just inside the john 30 it s about 34 33 degrees the handoff again goes inside and this time the giants are looking,0
for jim kentucky number 73 made the first contact alex webster the coach of the new york giants the advance is down close to the,0

quite a year with a new york giant let s make the point to done that the eagles are king on johnson all night tonight,0
for the run well i think if they dont theyre a lot of trouble ill also two yards on the preceding play at second down,0

and moved up into the swablu top of fredrickson he s been a prime receiver this time he goes deep to mcneal cook from scottie,0
and he is fought and he is dragged down by ray jones but not until he reaches the philadelphia 25yard line sajin says mcneil and,0
he have just gotten together in the last couple of weeks he thinks mcneil is going to do well actually is the big figure theyre,0
passing him you saw a very good what we used to call a dig out pattern ray jones was the defender number 21 a good,0

mcneal he goes over the middle is incomplete rage own his hands and mcneil not get away from it that s two plays that are,0
where a jones has been a signal figure play was one of three defensive backs drafted by the national football league from southern university another,0
noted one number 48 on green bay kenny ellis but ray is a rookie as all rookies will he has made mistakes and fran is,0

slant out he s coming he s got adrian young the linebacker number 35 and that was a great block he came back on the,0
inside they didnt pick up much yardage but johnson is a utility like it can do it all call it a four yard pickup make,0
it third down a long six consecutive about six and a half yards for the guy that s the philadelphia it s one to one,0
and a half this time johnson is like to the left side knocking this pass or put them back neal is incomplete depending on the,0

the way that last time by wade key number 72 of eagle ball is on the 32 yard line philadelphia eagles have it first down,0
sneed again the botes and gorgeous runs into number 72 john baker who is in a defensive left tackle and baker is the first man,0
to get to him and knocks him down after one yard funny thing had lunch today but leonard tose the owner of the eagleton p,0
threats left the general manager the eagleclaw seven in a row everyone knows that after every game on modell the president the browns would call,0
in it and commiserate with him and the eagles won one and the browns lost and toast called modell pen berger said heard a second,0
down nine yards to go for philadelphia penalty flag down hand off the cyril pender and the ex from illinois gets up to about the,0
37 yard line but let s wait for the penalty on side gently against the new york giants again second one in this series pretty,0
dryer the defensive here for the giants hesitated to charge outside he s very quick he moves very well to the outside that last play,0
was a draw just to turn out blocked by number seven wait he again on dryer they came back inside of him that a finalist,0
over to the outside they picked up a pretty good d ball is up on the 13 well let s call it the 38 yard,0
line and they could second down and about four for philadelphia the time so leading by a score of three nothing 2 minutes and 45,0
seconds to play in the first quarter that again may have jumped the play goes up the middle there is negligible gain on it thing,0
i noticed a depressed li mochou enormous speed number 16 when there s a fumble or somebody going on there norman very casually walk back,0
to the back below that the motion was settled in there like in the middle of another good quarterback trait this time it was jim,0
kenickie who anticipated a little too much perhaps that s great penalties 15 yards against the john the football is resting at the 43yard line,0
first down eagle their own 43 the time to leading three nothing need to focus focus is hit in the backfield by fred dryer but,0
moves ahead across the 45 up to about the 46 take a good shot at phrase ride number 89 is because he makes a great,0
move to get around weight key and just throws himself actually his putter bow just caught him with his arm i think she actually dumped,0
his arm little bill there he would look like you might have been hurt was a good move very good defensive play by brian he,0
is gonna be a very fine defensive end he already is a good defensive end but his first year he s done a great job,0
for the giant he s six six he s 240 in his second year from san diego state im sure don coryell remembers what he,0
used to do for him on second down and eight not much as well just tries to find some running room in ralph s tech,0
number 55 wrap the play that s how cold it is in philadelphia tonight that s a hand warmer it s cool i imagine a,0
briquettes or something like that but it keeps your hands warm and i wish we had four up here would you believe six as the,0
sidelines of the new york giants read webster alex webster who was a great star with them of course everybody remembers im short the ball,0
is placed back let s call it the 45 yard line make a third down and along 8 yards to go the eagles have been,0
on the third down hook now four times theyve made it twice need to throw get this pass away and it is sure he was,0
getting pleasure from fred briar wide alert somewhere the other defensive end the pass was intended for ben hawkins and philadelphia will have to kick,0
it away bill bradley the university of texas does the punting bobby devon and spider loc are 28 to 43 over deep men for the,0
dots dots wearing the white peers to kick five roughly and it is not a long kick effect advance toward the sideline but it s,0
going to be dead inside the 25yard line right around the 22 number 71 is bobbler samoa defensive left hand appears to have been shaken,0
on the last play the ball is at the 21yard line pushed down under new york times only ron johnson is back there was talkin,0
plaintiff load he able to average his pass intended for ron johnson is incomplete adrian young number 35 had come across to check on the,0
play as a matter of fact two linebackers were there rossovich and young boat see ron johnson number 30s he comes out of the backfield,0
adrian young 35 is right with him tim russell bitch im ready to is the middle linebacker he comes over to pray and receive some,0
pleasure in that back in the backfield and move johnson as you see held up there a little bit i tell you i spent two,0
or three days this past week with adrian young and tim russell hitch and i want to talk about these guys over there a couple,0
of real characters good football player itll be second down and 10 for the back from their own 21 talking them to blow penalty flag,0
is in the air and now on the field and talking to running for his life unloads it to cookson mcneil has no way through,0
the cliff good move by brando the smoke use excel cliff here here you take their you i take it done while we watch what,0
happens there on this flag that you were going to talk about young androkovich both being members of what they call a mod squad on,0
the eagle and of course the two with teammates that usa in the development of adrian young has been one of the major causes for,0
the extensible resurgence of the philadelphia eagles already had these guys were acted the cocaptains of the great ufc teams when they were winning for,0
big gang settlement west coast and they really have a real thing about this pilot part of the ballgame and they feel that violence is,0
certainly a big part of this football game in the physical part of it there are a couple of real good hitters illegal procedure declined,0
by the philadelphia eagles third down ten johnson 101 he wants to go beef equipment mcneal it is not the way incomplete by nick flimsy,0
who was with it all the way and they fight a better chance to crap but he chose to knock it away instead i wonder,0
if the fans heard some of those the bill was heard some of those eagles fans above us this way away to isolation on this,0
play the old pronate ramsey you see mcneal running a deep post pattern on ramsey ramsey is one of the true veterans in there i,0
dont think had a choice to catch it or not well he just did what he had to do at that time he was with,0
mcneal and hell has good speed is knocked it away he more the fourth celtics way from here from new york bill johnson will punt,0
then hawkins and billy wallet repeat i staffordshire adrian youre having the ball it is brilliant here the new york align philadelphia fall how about,0
that for a break in the game in the closing seconds of the first quarter many times weve seen this this year but these are,0
the mistakes that kill you this is the high snap he couldnt field it it is fourth down the eagles go get the ball anyway,0
adrian young number 35 did come in the eagles are ready up for this ballgame theyre going to play it as hard as they know,0
how to quote some ole miss and it is is our super bowl were going after the jump and time expire at the end of,0
the first quarter here at franklin field in philadelphia our score the new york giants 3 the philadelphia eagles heavy doorman speed with a golden,0
opportunity to put the philadelphia eagles on the scoreboard in the first quarter the eagles had 21 offensive plays against 15 for the new york,0
giants the eagles first then go to go on the new york new yard line this will be the first offensive play of the second,0
quarter it looks like we have a full house here and if we do better than fifty nine thousand it s going to be a,0
record weekend of attendance for the national football league first and goal to go from the two in there food and he pickle hard wet,0
on a full night he is sort of the touchdown him files the middle linebacker take a good look at jim pyles number 58 here,0
s the guy this is his responsibility to keep those guys from jumping over that line that s what they kind of do down there,0
if klaus is a good one he s a big rookie that s a giant for reprieve you seen meet fender right in here is,0
turning my absolute clip pender seen somewhere in those movies of years gone by that s what youre supposed to do on the gold line,0
is jump over them files and seen those same movie second down and goal to go about a foot away he put whenever youre in,0
doubt konya power right here now just push it all in there how do you do a st louis the cardinals knowing full well after,0
their chi yesterday a victory for the john could pull up within a half game here s the down number 16 north sea big strong,0
down number 16 north sea big strong powerful biglegged quarterback as all of them are boulders way across the new york defensive line for a,0
school here s the extra point drive by mark foley yes and i think it was well tech member 55 a long graphic ill tell,0
you that that could be a big one ralph heck who rented a house and found riggs new york in northern westchester youll see is,0
set up from the end zone camera in ralph heck is over 55 he comes in gets a big head in for this one and,0
i know it has been said a lot but seriously this is a big thing you know the extra point in football is usually like,0
a an ordinary thing there s old ralph peck number 55 and were going to be right back to see you just in a little,0
while im out right now well be back with the philadelphia kickoff in just a moment our score the eagle six the giants three share,0
in the little table to pick up the rack place see if you took away the mad search gives you and the survival manuals the,0
direct line phones from hotels and motels if you took away two 2730 processes around the world where you can pick up a four door,0
drop one off if you took away the computerized reservation system if you took away the express checkin system the special rate the hertz girl,0
if you took every hearst office to stays open all night and closed it at five and if you took away our good name hertz,0
would be left with the one basic thing every rentacar outfit can offer a calm but even when you get down to that we offer,0
more kinds of cars than anyone in the business 47 seconds into the second quarter the philadelphia eagles have taken the lead by a score,0
of 6 to 3 the giants well peck luck the extra point try bobby duhon and less guy or the deep men or two giants,0
25 is shy here s the kickoff by mostly it is very short and it goes down to number 33 joe green for the class,0
and joe comes back to the 36 yard line first in town for new york they call him little joe greenie from bowling green but,0
they know on the giant squad that is the toughest strongest man in inch for inch and bounced around on the squad who decided that,0
howard i will how did they decide that brand talking sinto me and pig bled out i want to make sure it was some authority,0
i formation it is tucker frederickson ron johnson fan talking to the quarterback don herrmann is wide to the left neck view to the right,0
they break off the i go to jonathan is caught in the secondary by mel tom and dragged on he may have picked up one,0
yard theyll give him two will be second down eight you know this game is a long way to go but that was the kind,0
of justice and snead scoring that touchdown to malign quarterback through all the years talking didnt see both characterises nonwinners and both in the key,0
games tonight on second down and eight from the 37 yard line outside the 37 his ron johnson he is fifth at the line of,0
scrimmage but he has great balance and his momentum carries him to the 44 ron porter the tackle for philadelphia i dont know any really,0
about how these trades are made no i saw a jazz but i would imagine that new york giant people are kind of smiling with,0
old ron johnson and jim kenickie on their side this year i would think id be a pretty good trait that s the safe comment,0
okay tahoe can you get it thank you ive had a little difficulty in my little comments lately aaron thomas is in the ballgame number,0
88 the veterans of oregon state this is hunter subjects in auburn across midfield of the philadelphia 49 yard line he is cooked down by,0
speed freaks you know what i keep using the word nice guy but this this one really is a nice guy and you talk about,0
company men whether you like them or whether you dont tucker believes in the new york jets you see him running a power offside he,0
got a good block he came in tucker is a great blocker he s been known for his blocking ability he s been hurt he,0
s had some bad knees he s a really good guy im glad to see him have a good year for first 49 yard line,0
again it is friendship nef power he goes to the 46 43 rossovich the tackle for philadelphia and now it s a mean danya faced,0
the danger of being called provincial and a homer forget it tucker frederickson is one the world s great people and most courageous to knee,0
operation given up on and out there and doing an honest and good job this year suck it down seven yards to go josh caught,0
up with 406 parker been running deep he s got the screen set off 200 sin oh it is busted wide open by a wild,0
man samer off of it wow i look like he s knee went out of that pen that screen was set up pretty good he,0
had adrian young number 35 coming in there on him france ended up good throughout to tucker and home tim did come in there ill,0
tell you tim is a heck of a competitor and he loves to hit them rough it s 82 there was a gain of two,0
yards on the play down to the 44 yard line itll be third down and five yards to go for the giants let s see,0
if they can get off the hook the temperatures now below 30 degrees tarkington baklava goes over the meadow first reception of the night at,0
the 39yard line itll be close to the first ow on tucker and a bloom skirt steak pasta who played with the lowell minor league,0
club a farm club for the paper given up on bob tucker given up on by these very same eagles bob tucker who got a,0
shot with the giants and who s been a key figure in their success this year a very intriguing story and an evidence of what,0
can happen in the national football league how a man can come from no errors and nobody and become a very biggest pig somebody first,0
on new york philadelphia 39 ron johnson and game tackling by the eagles number 77 ernie callaway was the man who made the play gary,0
williams the coach of the philadelphia eagles we share the old alma mater he s from the great pacific northwest washington state university second down,0
and ten new york philadelphia 39 parkington wants to throw it unloads at the predator and ron order runs him down inside the 30 at,0
about the 28 yard line it may be another first round higher if you go see flex number 24 if he comes out of the,0
back theyll actually run port number if he stays in there a little bit too long he doesnt cover person that s his men talking,0
to friends they said his friends how are you hitting you back so much you can im keying a land backer if theyre not on,0
oh maybe im going to hit them because you dont have to throw it that far it is a first down for the giants and,0
the advance of the ball is to the 27 yard line this is ron johnson last week number 88 gary pettigrew was involved in the,0
group of green shirts that got him so was ross of it and so it s quarter that s right keith so was number 82,0
tim rossovich and done later on we should discuss i think what it s meant the tim ross of it could become converted from the,0
defensive end to a middle linebacker and overall what a job he s done i agree with you howard one thing id like to point,0
out about that wyatt bull sack they had their brand ran out a quick count whether he game us george or not the eagles now,0
know he can run when everybody s in the backfield second time seven from the 24 park in this pass it is moronic neal it,0
is brought by mcneal coming over their defense al nelson one of the many as you know teeth from grambling cowell story about al howard,0
he yet heart murmur during training camp i couldnt figure out what caused it wound up infected tooth thank heavens pinky pfft talking to now,0
seven out of 12 80yard the ball is on the 24 yard line third down seven new york philadelphia 24 mcneil is wide left ray,0
jones comes right up nose to nose with him parkington looks and goes deeper mcneil he s wide open oh oh oh here remember that,0
book hey oh my goodness everything is really nice on this play until the very end of it we going to take a look at,0
old clifton and he comes back out of here and he s got ray jones on him clifton is going to run a pretty good,0
rowdy because back gives him that inside fake goes back to the outside he s got him beat and my good is he him in,0
a bad place hed go galax in the ball game hell try a field goal on fourth down and seven he s going to hit,0
it from just outside the 30yard line he can tie it up or he missed it it is wide to the left wait a minute,0
he s off with his head hanging low disaster 850 to go first half time our franklin theo philadelphia score eagle 63 delphia eagles in,0
green have the football first and 10 at their own 20yard line it was expected to be brenigan in the neighborhood and that s what,0
it s been so far a 50 to go first half eagles lead by score of 6 to 3 jon beat go alexis missed a,0
field goal and the eagles have enough speed got to throw well one is wide open and gary is up to the 35 yard line,0
for a 15 yard gain on the play tom longo 44 led the tackling for the giants we have penalty flags on the field so,0
hang on the indication the initial indication against the eagles and it s obviously against them theyre backing up and it s got the look,0
of an offensive holding pennell what it is then this type of happenstance or circumstance however youd like to call it it s cause the,0
eagles homeless problem this year theyve had a lot of fun with buildings and key situations interceptions fumbles heavy able to stay to drive the,0
ball is put down just outside the 5yard line well call it four five it s going to be first down and 25 sarah pender,0
oh ball is loose jerry permit 30 things on the football as a pretty good hit and going on there ill tell you give me,0
files knocked it loose and scott eaton covered it not even dolf the critical fumbles and well watch this and slomo done well you see,0
him come around a quick pitch bender has it he s coming in there youll see eating number 20 from the side i think eating,0
is actually part of that reason for it but files of a 58 comes in the ball just popped loosens got progressive parity of this,0

mcneal on his live receiver position around the end and he s inside the cabin rattle about the stick he has a good job of,0
ball handling there by old presidents i say he gave a pretty good fake in there to johnson number 30 he came in it clipped,0
it came around the outside let s take a look at it you got justin coming in playing takes the ball fake johnson holds it,0
in there flips it back out to mcneil number 18 comes rip course slip and has great speed he does get outside the eagle defense,0

feel his way along and he comes in and actually was the one that put tucker ferguson back but they do pick up first then,0
at this point gary williams going to the experience and putting law it in at the middle line blocking position first and goal to go,0
ron johnson put down down let s take a look at it again ron johnson number 30 if he comes in frank gives it to,0
his money man you see tucker number 24 he comes in gives a pretty good block johnson just closed himself on top of that line,0
there very closely you come in for the score so french this goes to the sidelines having done his job that is the tenth touchdown,0
of the year for ron johnson new york johnson we regained the lead and keep goggle ak will try to make it a kenda six,0
ballgame never has a block play a 15 more important offsides the giants that should nullify the extra point which was good let s see,0
if it goes against the giants no it s against the eagle so theyve got declined and obviously theyll take the point so we have,0
a timeout here at franklin field in philadelphia 655 to go first half the score now the new york giants 10 the philadelphia eagles six,0

many of you know each week the coaches grade these defensive players actually da 50 players and jerry shea is the man the defensive line,0
who week to week i understand has had the highest grade i dont know exactly how they grade them but that tells me that he,0
s playing very consistent ball for the giants and has given them a real plug there in the middle got him some atlanta and nobody,0
can understand the deal second down and nine and a half really and hawkins his in table is off here it goes jackson hell hit,0
too many falls down in that i feel a loss play i didnt fool anybody didnt fool jim pout well the interesting thing about this,0
team thisis norm hasnt completed a pass yet to harold jackson has completed a pass yet to ben hawkins you know it s hard to,0
understand because these are two great receivers and youve got to give a lot of credit to the giants defense which has come from noah,0
dont you agree indeed and ill tell you the development of drier at defensive right in has been as much and the presence of files,0
and the continued play affect offense tremendous assets for the giants third down 14 the ball at the 37 here s the pitch and there,0
s mr files again at the 41yard line i tell you that s nothing else there s there s a couple extra backs on that,0
third down in low situation it didnt fool files they kept bender out of the backfield and that certainly his men he was right there,0

detective dan august is forced to face the fact that an old high school football buddy i have been involved in a scandalous murder wednesday,0
night on abc there are ballplayers i know ron medved will come into the ball game in the defensive secondary for the philadelphia eagles replacing,0
ray jones who has left the field ron methvin took the blame in the dallas game for ilan quest down passes a zone was open,0
itll be third down in a half a yard before the giants just shy of their own 35 and i got johnson adrian young hit,0
him just short of the line of scrimmage but i think perhaps ron had enough to get it to the 35 and he did just,0
having to run medved chief he was written up in life magazine during the bidding war and the hand holds those of you remember like,0
it was during the pro football war he was well they stayed with him through his wedding and his honeymoon unbelievable ive known him a,0
long time he s going to como played at the university of washington here s tarkington 1st down and 10 ruling his master s away,0
and mcneil is wide open and he is out of bounds across midfield it will be a new york first down i like this type,0
of pattern you got mcneal coming down he s old number 24 ramsey if he comes down the back here it was a sideline pattern,0
free and run rolls out of the backfield this eliminates the growl out of the immediate pressure that you get from the off it from,0
the defensive line you see number 26 now nelson is here on him out of bound i like that has a changeup and free and,0
i know he likes that he uses it quite a bit has been very effective for this year its first round drives close to the,0
eagle 48 yard line mcneil is to the left this time parkington great pleasure from rossovich unloads the frederickson and focus football and it s,0
recovered by herman inside the 20yard line very years and there a year and some years everything goes right ill say it is he caught,0
up list by the eagle defense that time well see here on slow motion you saw but actually we dont pick it up as tucker,0
craig s and catches the ball what you didnt see was a blitz by the eagle defense bringing the great jump getting that one off,0
35 adrian young comes in he hit tucker and slicker goes down the ball does slipped loose picked up i believe by herman i think,0
is the man that recovers that ball number 85 for the giants and howard says when you get it going then it goes good john,0
s called time to stop the clock with about 59 seconds to go and talking to miss hattie s sideline conference with alex webster coming,0
up at halftime howard cosell well have highlights of the san francisco detroit game green bay minnesota dallas washington baltimore line san diego oakland george,0

i do for you im holding both here he s my hero and i why is sinatra sing the song who makes me feel so,0
young first down john philadelphia 18 plan to throw going to go deep mcneil s over there it is hidden complete and speed priest number,0
33 made a fine defensive play for the eagle now this was almost hung up a little bit too much the windmill credit he got,0
priest number 33 as he s defending again goes out inside fake that mcneal gave him bran laid the ball up but as you can,0
see theyre slowing down a little bit there that was almost intercepted you never do know maybe the ball slow down a bit further maybe,0
they thought maybe he wouldnt but brees actually didnt go for that inside faking so he was the second to the outside that was the,0
pattern that mcneil was home was open and a little bit earlier in the ballgame leave out of justin our athlete picked up a fumble,0
around 21 yards for the score here s talking the second down pin it passes away it s going incomplete to mcneil and again clifton,0
headaches get her off his fingertips it s a very cold night the temperature is now less than 30 and the chill factor certainly much,0
lower than that quite he s thrown the clifton mcneil donnas mentioned clifton it from grambling tower and that s become a legend 100 yards,0
to glory the point im trying to make is it nearly onefifth of all the people in the nfl this is a very important thing,0
in our society have come in the southwest athletic conference grambling college texas coming jack third down 10 18 yard line john 7 talking to,0
good protection his pass is incomplete and give tim rossovich a lot of credit for breaking up that one again mcneal with the target i,0
was with reservations i said earlier actually saturday night and honestly surly i was with steve sabol over to steve sabol is the son of,0
it labeled nfl field and we saw the dick butkus film three times the sixminute excerpt about the violence and the physical aspect of football,0
and being a quarterback i really had told of that but these guys believe in being physical and there certainly has been physical tonight pete,0
go calacas in the ball game on fourth down hell try a field goal from the 25yard line it s got the upright 9 plays,0
75 yards and the new york giants build their lead to 13 to 6 over the eagles and we have 40 seconds to play in,0

yard line to wallet he s got a hole to her miss thing no it s over life and pete agonal run back for the,0

those scenes youll see him nap turtle the scene if he goes through how you do huh number 28 did missing goggle act like a,0
set that s a liveaction time about dawn the pass intended on a quick one to poachers from speed it is incomplete files and hecla,0
there for the giants the clock stops at twenty seconds to go ive got to tell you folks it s unreal we came up to,0
the booth tonight don meredith and i and don said at least once tonight billy wallach number nine is going to break one now i,0
didnt break it all the way but he puts them in field goal position good work john thank you on our shuttle riversleigh in there,0
but if i said it by golly im will stick to it why do you always do that for our 39 yard 39 yard line,0
clicks down the passage good to hawken and hooking this down to the 4 yard line they call them out no jim hawkins number 18,0
in your program rob longo was having a fight with ben for the ball but been hung on the tourney is patterned by hagen did,0
it goes off the line theyre trying to get pretty good field goal position hesoh got eight number twenty hook in there behind a good,0
pass spot lead they just moved it down a little bit closer ring auggie s a heck of a better time logoed over 44 is,0
the guy who comes in put the finishing touches over the first pass reception by a knockin picked up in the pro football or why,0
do you go against the jet remember theyre going to try to get one more play before the half theyre gambling they can get at,0
least one maybe they can get the six kenickie goes out of the lineup for the new york giants we have 10 seconds to go,0
in the first half need looks into the end zone he goes to the endzone for boom and he goes licked by him incomplete see,0
what he threw his eye when the only place you can throw it now palmer couldnt get to it but he zipped it right in,0
there five my man hazeltine number 64 they did have him covered very well that last pattern but that s what it thought in there,0
im glad you pointed out old folks matthew was right back there with him now the field goal units in there mark mosley number three,0
will try the field goal he s going to have to kick it 29 yards he has the mild wind that is fast that was,0
clean the kick is up but it is done by all sides against new yorker so that will be declared you are right and we,0
have come birthing into the first half and our score at the end of the first half the new york giants 13 and the philadelphia,0
eagles have nine hours hotel back in a moment for the look of the highlights of yesterday s nfl action right after this field so,0
else 13:9 giants halftime score tough game don meredith key points i think a couple of fumbles howard you got a fumbled punt and you,0
also got a follow down in offensive territory did in a big place with a eagle david johnson it s a close ballgame there s,0
a lot of hitting out there and it is cold here in philadelphia and im looking for the second half were going to see who,0
s going to win a lot of people thought that the giant transformation from inefficiency the total efficiency was unreal youre coming well i think,0
the giants are doing a fine job yesterday they pulled everything together they seemed to have again i hate you use this with the momentum,0
that is necessary to be a winning ballclub and i know talking to the files of the guys that are doing it i think im,0
"totally right back to cute and the philadelphia eagles get a roar from the 59,000 bus here at franklin field in philadelphia as they come",0
back on the field having made their presence certainly felt here in the first half against the new york giants who have been a redhot,0
ballclub those are the eagles wearing the green again let us make the point as they came into the ballgame tonight the new york giants,0
faced this situation the st louis cardinals leading the eastern division of the national conference with a record of 72 and one the giants 6,0
and 3 coming into this ballgame they need it and those are the half time mystics the giants having run off 38 offensive plays against,0
33 for philadelphia the first downs again reflecting the number of plays involved the yards rushing yards passing however the giants have a substantial edge,0
121 through the eagles 42 and the total yards again lying in the favor of the new york giants over the philadelphia eagles the eagles,0
will kickoff to start the second half of play with a score at halftime 13 tonight in a ballgame that was considered going into the,0
game i was expected to be i should say a real brawl and it s been just that in the first meeting of the year,0
the giants wanted by a score of 32 23 they broke on top 23 nothing the eagles came back that the giants wanted here is,0
the kickoff by mark mobley and it goes to bobby duhon up on the 13 yard line and do high brings it back to about,0
the 35 yard line so the giants will have it first and 10 it was fred hill that knocked duhon from tulane audubon alright our,0
ball game is underway willie banks number 60 is they changed the offensive line for the new york giants willie young number 69 is there,0
and he s played every game for the giants achebe became a new york time the center is greg larson doug van horn is on,0
the right side at guard dick buzzin will be on the right side of taco bob tucker number 38 will be the tight end ran,0
takamina quarterback with but dixon and johnson set behind him like me oh to the right they go to johnson in the backfield back on,0
the 30yard line gary pettigrew number 88 at adrian young number 35 were the two eagles that got him a loss of four yards on,0
the play itll be second down and 14 for the new york giants against the opposition this year the second quarter has been the toughest,0
quarter for the philadelphia eagles they have given up 92 points sporting on the 39 the third quarter the eagles have an edge 49 47,0
over the opposition let s see what happened here on second down and 14 talking to the flow he swings it off the fender trim,0
and tucker coming up field is cut down by adrian young as he gets to the 40 yard line theyve got to go just beyond,0
the 44 to get the first down so it s going to be third down and a very long four yard or new york we,0
are in the third quarter of play tucker fredrickson has caught five passes in the game tonight for 71 yards don a ron johnson in,0
the first half picked up on the 13 yards rushing and the hodel fee illegal said they were going to doubleteam him they meant exactly,0
what they were saying tarkington guilty johnson he is flat down at the line of scrimmage gary pettigrew number 88 set his feet out from,0
under him as he advanced the ball to the 41 yard line the giants are going to have to kick it away on third down,0
at about for number 83 coming off the field is done holt they defensive left tackle who works alongside gary if had a groove the,0
a defensive left end is ernie callaway and mel calm at the right side the giants bill young is in the ball game to punt,0
billy wallach number 9 is the man the eagles like to have returned the ball bill johnson left puts it at the low kick it,0
is very short it is bouncing downfield and it is taken by dan hawkins at huh then almost broke it out of there he almost,0
slipped out of the huddle and got away with it but he was tripped up and it will be towed off his ball first and,0
ten at their own 33 matt is out here at franklin field in philadelphia the scores you see john 13 the eagles knock no a,0
new studded town and country winter tire you can put on all four wheels of your car to really improve your stopping ability on ice,0
with just two new firestone town and country studded tires on the rear do still stop and youve stopped a lot quicker than with just,0
two ordinary studded with her tires on the rear firestone s new asymmetrical common country tire with 112 safety stun available where lawns permit gives,0
us more reasons than ever to say you go through ice mutters snow or we pay the toll if anybody tells you that ordinary snow,0
tires are as good as fire stones new are symmetrical town in countries tell amis all wet look for the new asymmetrical town and country,0
winter tire from firestone the mileage specialist were in the third quarter of play list adjusted the story on long smith the philadelphia eagles quarterback,0
as the eagles come up 1st down and 10 at their own 33 yard line a throw by four currently 13 deny dr past he,0
has plenty of time his past is caught by hawkins wide open at midfield and then takes it down to the giants 42 yard line,0
before matt hazeltine number 64 brings him down the temperature now well under 30 degrees the expected low tonight in philadelphia down around 20 degrees,0
and it is hidden there in a hurry that s call at the 41 yard line the ball is marked just outside the 41 number,0
29 is farrell jackson the quick wide receiver for the eagles get hawkins ridge wide to the right jackson to the left hinder and bo,0
just set behind sneed and that s bogus and so just he is cut down by threat dyer number 89 here s a shot of,0
freddie dryer number 89 because of this devious is right in position actually this play is going up into the middle youll see him take,0
an inside move and he comes across to stop this play for basically no game the pursuit the quickness and actually the strength of the,0
joseph dreyer is going to be a great asset for the giant defense with any years itll be second down and nine philadelphia new york,0
40 yard line charlie harper out of the lineup here s the pass over the middle hawkins is wide open then hawkins is down to,0
the 15 yard line first down philadelphia well sex wait to talk over the time im saying it s a pretty big hole in that,0
middle that s where hawkins was while ago when he caught that plate he came from the inside i was kind of attorney in pattern,0
and it seems two defensive backs with the giants are kind of laying back a little bit maybe they respect talking speed a little bit,0
too much because if you give him that shot in the middle there he can shake him loose in a hurry no good thing up,0
in great field position right now the catch by the fiveyear veteran from arizona state takes the ball down to new york 13 first down,0
and 10 philadelphia seed gives it two bulges and the big kid from louisville is out of the ten yard line before jim kenickie number,0
73 puts him away people have asked me keys many times where is it and this is when we must leave the catalyst was you,0
guys look so good between the 20 and i guess ill think you in my own defense for the defense is all offensive needs when,0
you get inside the 20 you dont have nearly as much room to work against and you know youve got a an enzoani gown dry,0
to work against when you get to nearly as many things as you get out in the middle of the field so this has been,0
tough yardage down here jackson is wide to the left side norm s need at the 10yard line on second down and seven gives it,0
the cylinder and pender is grabbed by number 75 jerry shave he tries to slide away he worked his way down close to the seventh,0
jerry shea is really not his man he changed his name was the polish man im a gave me try to pronounce but he changed,0
his name legally it is very shame i forgot he did sure glad you asked me to try to pronounce it ball is on the,0
7 yard line it is third down and four at the giants evan johnson leading 13 to 9 it goes burgess oh look at him,0
power and he s done about the 2 yard line it will be first and goal to go for philadelphia at the time to write,0
his closest were told that earlier now he s got the good speed he s got the good side this was a power play off,0
the right side of the line you just follow on your camera there in an accident just great power running soul blocking buys when bob,0
mertz woman and tom lowe go number 44 for the journals it probably made the stop on him power running to the right side of,0
the offensive line for the philadelphia eagles are standing gold ago the annual brawl between the giants of the eagles at franklin field in philadelphia,0
it s about 26 degrees first and goal to go from the to go just he doesnt get much that was the same play they,0
tried the play before and giants are no dummies they were looking part scott eaton came up in there and made a good play number,0
20 go green number 33 was also in all that flavor very little gain on the play the ball is still about the two yard,0
line there s coach jerry williams pacing the sideline good reason for him wearing that hat ill say right now weve done the fair left,0
over second down and goal to go from the two gorgeous oh did he get ripped my files now we saw files in a preseason,0
game against pittsburgh and this was early in the season files didnt release how a good feel for this thing but theyve been telling me,0
all week before this files is knowing where it s going so youll see him there number 58 he s following that play along if,0
one thing to follow the play it s something else to do something about it when you get there and that s meeting it headon,0
and prepared for it and then well give that decision to file though the big o key 1:1 it is down on the oneyard line,0
third down and goal to go the eagles would like to have six they got to get it right here need push down and fred,0
hill the pine and put it they goes ten yards the template at 61 yards for the touchdown or the most effective plays in my,0
opinion that you can have on the goal line is when you have an option to run or throw it puts a tremendous amount of,0
pressure on the defense you saw norman see that time fake who s running back they have to protect against the run came up the,0
receivers wide open oh fred hill double southern california gets the touchdown and here s the point after try by mark bosley penalty flags on,0
the field the kick is up it is and we got some extra curricular activities to put the feel right now which what make it,0
a physical game at six minutes 35 seconds to go in the third quarter which emma got into a beef with a couple of eagle,0
and they break it up nobody s like show them eagles market 61 yards in ten play is going to touchdown and the indication by,0
the referee jack vest offside against the giants personal foul against philadelphia so well do it again weve come to the handwarmer on the sidelines,0
now ive got to go back first element you see to block text reports in one ball game but if they were to block this,0
one this really would make a big point because theyre now hit 15 to 13 if they do kick their extra board will put up,0
a field goal in front let s see what happened nobody was spanish from the game as a result of that brief altercation here s,0
the clock in by moses this time he throws it there are no penalty flag nfl monday night football from franklin field in philadelphia pennsylvania,0
will continue in a moment our for now the philadelphia eagles 16 and the new york guy 13 is forced memory the simple machine symbol,0
to own drive and service and this is one of the strongest quietest board ever built the 1971 ford ltd but small cars arent big,0
enough for some people and others dont need a large car so ford has something right in the middle you should know about torino if,0
you like small car prices and the sportyer way small guy panel but you dont want to give up the smoother ride of a big,0
car or room for six remember ford s got something right in the middle torino and you can take your choice of sedans wagons sports,0
roofs hide tops even a convertible when you want some of the things from a small car and some of the things from a big,0
car you want something right in the middle torino all 14 models are available if your ford dealers now ford gives you better ideas number,0
three mark mosely the pride of stephen f austin state will tee it up and deep for the giants less guy and baba duhon the,0
eagles leading by 316 to 13 the kick goes to less giant the six yard line there s a little feeding down haha id make,0
you the fun game it was bill hobbs who laid it to him at the sideline less shy number 25 the judge just threw the,0
cowboys one time mchugh in the huddle left unless what you will run he says maybe you call it now run it shutting the touchdown,0
we saw like oh you saw norma s need fake into the middle of the line actually he gets tripped up a little bit there,0
by i dont lose offensive lineman but you also saw hill fred hill number 86 wide open behind scottie he cant really fault got that,0
much because he no pro got a protect for the outside run the personal foul penalty goes against fidel fiy eagles the giants half of,0
all at their own 39 yard line first down vaughn johnson and one gets it up to the 44 yard line before he is billed,0
back by ten rossovich the giants trailing by three have to win it because if they lose it theyll drop behind the st louis cardinals,0
the cardinals will the tie yesterday a victory by the giants tonight that pull them within a half game or people within a half game,0
so it is a mustwin posture for the new york giants the dodge facing a rough schedule ahead ron johnson picks up on the 14,0
yards tonight in welfare here we go he had a little daylight this time before adrian young runs in god as he reaches philadelphia country,0
at the 49 yard line youll see runs just coming out of the i formation the stack in the backfield over 24 is tucker frederick,0
says he throws a block on the defensive tackles johnson cut in behind that block on the end comes to the outside ross fish the,0
rays who misses him slightly there he comes back across you got adrian young number 35 he comes back across number 99 mel tom with,0
the finishing touches oney we play off the eyes five minutes and ten seconds to go third quarter eagle 16 john 13 first down new,0
york philadelphia 49 talking to dumpster depended for frederick s of incomplete to choice that is perhaps a good thing for the preservation of tucker,0
fredrickson because there were five green shirt waiting for it gary pettigrew number 88 was a minute led that charge in there this is a,0

steelers with perhaps principal interest say to to fund the home debut of the most touted rookie quarterback since joe willie namath came into the,0
pros number 12 terry bradshaw from louisiana tech fran tarkenton will not be quarterbacking tonight for the giants he s got an injury in his,0
stead will be a former steeler number 11 dick shiner but let s get a firsthand report on fran chalking tintin fran himself and fran,0
first the injury is that anything to be concerned about not at all howard im fine you are youll be sitting action then next week,0
yeah i will against philadelphia in principle all right your club is moving more and more to the i formation tell us very quickly the,0
advantages of that formation well it s more deceptive i think howard you can get a good inside running game and of course we spread,0
out off of it cinnamon in motion and with marshall to come out of the backfield it makes it a very effective formation for us,0
now tell us to what to look for in dick shiner tonight he hasnt had that much exposure around the country well dixon is seventh,0
year in pro football but what amazes me about that he s got probably the most powerful throwing arm howard that ive seen and i,0
know he s very anxious to play against his ex teammates tonight he feels like he should be here quarterbacking them and im sure dick,0
s gonna do a great job for us and very quickly they called you the newlook giants are you that much better we sure are,0
howard we feel we are and were going to be a lot better i hope in three weeks when the season starts like im sure,0

game will have an a special meaning for a lot of the players on this gridiron tonight howard i think youre certainly right because we,0
are coming down to that final cutting time by next monday midnight all clubs will have to be at the 49 player limit now the,0
pittsburgh steelers before we start this game tonight have 58 players on their roster they new york giants have 55 so the jobs are up,0
for grabs as of tonight for these two teams all right thank you very much keith and now to introduce to you our last but,0
not least colleague himself one of the great names in the chronicle of nfl football the past quarterback of the dallas cowboys don meredith and,0
done i would think the question for terry bradshaw in the ultimate would have to be this can a rookie quarterback really lead a team,0
in this league to a winning season what do you think howard i dont think he can but you know that s not really very,0
important what is important is the fact that terry bradshaw thinks that he can you know i kind of like him he i like the,0
way he throws i like the way he kind of moves out there and i liked his answer to my question about the leadership role,0
to the pittsburgh steelers when he said you know pittsburgh needs a leader and i can lead them i cant bless the child can stand,0
up and say i got my own and as dizzy dean said partner if you can do it it aint bragging so well take a,0
look tonight and find out okay nd don meredith were about ready now i think for the national anthem and then the opening game kickoff,0

is come to marlboro country for the pittsburgh steelers this is their third preseason football game they were defeated by the miami dolphins one of,0
the more improved ball clubs this year 16 to 10 but then the next week behind the rookie terry bradshaw bounced back to beat the,0

diego by 3 and defeated the new york jets in their last outing 28 to 24 so the giants string three ones across their record,0
these two ball clubs have played 70 times in their history the new york giants have won 42 the steelers have 125 there have been,0
three times new york has won five in a row but the steelers wearing the black shirts and the gold numerals figure tonight theyre going,0
to turn it around receivers for the receiving pittsburgh steelers they won the toss preston pearson number 26 he can fly and number 33 john,0

and we have no score bill johnson will do the punting or the new york giants the deep men are hubie bryant number 32 and,0

game these two football teams have played the giants have won five in a row they trail seven nothing first quarter alex webster the head,0
coach of the giants he was a great star number 29 or the blue fredrickson and johnson are the setbacks the dance had not gone,0
to the eye so far here s shiner on a deep retreat sets up the screen throws it to fredrickson tucker and a man that,0
made the tackle for the pittsburgh steelers john rouser number 48 a cornerback four year veteran from michigan the ball is put at the 49,0

the steelers have won one and lost one they lost to the miami dolphins to start the year in preseason play then came back to,0
beat the minnesota vikings and in their third game they would like to add the new york giants kelp to their strength terry bradshaw is,0
the quarterback ukwon pearson trauma set backs now the ball is given to preston pearson trying to get away at a hole closed on him,0
but the giant defense who would like to pin the steelers deep in their own territory hold him down and his fred dryer penetrating to,0
make the tackle for the giants the new york giants in white on a very warm night in three rivers stadium in pittsburgh pennsylvania a,0
loss on the previous play two yards second down and 12 for the steelers dupois flies the left side and ralph peck gets him as,0
he gets up through the original line of scrimmage about the nine yard third down coming up got eaten number 20 there in white one,0
of the basketball players who has made it in professional football in from oregon state on third down and about ten let s see what,0
terry bradshaw can do with it he fires he hits him and he brian build at the 20 yard first down for pittsburgh here s,0
a great turn in route by hebe bryant youll notice the back came out of the backfield i can pile the line back here again,0
he was man to man came in and that was right on the lumbers ball is on the 22 yard line first down pittsburgh steelers,0
lead 7 nothing 3:20 to play in the first quarter a bust it s a big number 74 tackle started pulling out before the snap,0
of the ball john brown the offensive right back what this this happens to kate and i think 74 is gonna pull on that plate,0
he was gonna make sure he got out in front but you build on your bradshaw bradshaw is like with winning when he s got,0
that ball those things happen folks i dont know what causes him alex webster probably enjoying it first down and 15 back at the 17,0
yard line for the pittsburgh steelers they lead the giants 7 nothing bradshaw to throw swings it out to pierson weston has lost none of,0
the speed he had 11yard pickup now they finally put it very near the 30yard line so here is a trade preston pearson coming from,0
baltimore to pittsburgh that has looked very good for the steelers in the first quarter keith one thing that last green pass bradshaw does an,0
excellent job of waiting to the very last second to get rid of the ball that s a real key to running a screen pass,0
you did a good job on that one suck him down and call it two yards for pittsburgh just short of the 30 pearson first,0
down still going 38 yard line sam davis a fouryear veteran from allen university leading the blocking on the play so alex webster who has,0
watched his defense grow for us at times in the preseason games facing the sidelines and preston pearson having a big first quarter he s,0
carried eight times he has gained 43 yards bradshaw has it once the trophy flips it back across the field and complete the bob adams,0
the tight end two year veteran from pacific scott eaton cut the pins from under him but he had possession long enough game from day,0
38 to the 44 second down and four coming up steelers young coach chuck noll is born with a lot of rookie talent this year,0
were inside a minute to go first quarter pass is deflected by number 79 of the new york giants a wizard number 89 fred dreyer,0
got his hands up bradshaw had his man open he could have dumped it and probably picked up his first down not after that big,0
lineman stood up 46 seconds remaining the giant defense of the 20 is eaten by de lockhart 4348 is al brenner of michigan state bradshaw,0
back to throw third down and four swings it out the kiss he s got the first round he is down to the new york,0
giants forty yard line and a penalty flag is down on the play and i tell you i really do i like your style what,0
s here what s bradshaw here number 12 they had a safety blitz youll see the reported threecar lockhart come in he backed up he,0
read it and flipped out i like it made a good move this run reston pearson preston is having a very fun night tonight and,0
hell be bryant over there trying to block for pearson nailed with a holding penalty so the offensive holding a major call 15yard penalty against,0
the pittsburgh steelers weve probably put this down as time goes on but a quarterback loves to see a defensive unit blitz if he knows,0
where his people are because when they bless theyve got a mantoman coverage that last time the safety came i left a big hole down,0
the middle didnt have enough time to throw there but he didnt know where all the receivers were and flipped out i thought that was,0
an excellent job to you don meredith formerly of the dallas cowboys with us along with howard cosell as we go to primetime with nfl,0
football the giants and steelers and bradshaw to throw fires a bullet for the first down yeah third down and eight ron shanklin number 25,0
made the catch got eaten number 20 made the tackle for the jump and it s a first down ball is up the 49 yard,0
line and the clock is running as we near the end of the first quarter carrie bradshaw 63 215pound brings his team up to the,0
line of scrimmage as the gun cracks and we come to the end of the first period at the end of the first quarter here,0
at three rivers stadium in pittsburgh our score pittsburgh steelers 7 the new york giants nothing these are the men of the national football league,0
and theyre in a tough business when their days done they want a lot of attention without asking for it and a little understanding that,0
s why the businessman of the nfl fly united airlines in fact 24 the 26 nfl teams choose united if we can take good care,0
of them you can bet we can take good care of you that s fran tarkenton number 10 they for starting quarterback for the new,0
york giants but he will not play tonight he told howard cosell as you may have heard at the top of the game with just,0
before the kickoff that his leg was all right dick shiner is the man wholl do the quarterbacking tonight for the giants but right now,0
let s watch young terry bradshaw as he tries to move the pittsburgh steelers from the giant 48 yard line question pearson who has been,0
a terror so far in the ballgame he is down to the 40 for the steelers 40yard line in new york territory willie williams of,0
grambling makes the tackle you talk about a game plan working the perfection is don meredith mentioned earlier we visited at length with bradshaw this,0
morning he actually moved to the blackbaud drill for us how easily he felt the steelers could run against the giants based upon what they,0
had seen the jets do against the giants on the ground a week ago and it s working out john meredith exactly the way bradshaw,0
picturised i think it is he s actually even grew up a couple of past patterns itll work for us through howard second down and,0
to wall pittsburgh at the new york 40 steelers lead 7 nothing pearson more steelers repainted bob demarco number 51 the center came over to,0
the leaf on the ball for pittsburgh but this is just a missed block west number he s changing directions dont blame him come in,0
back he swings the ball he just loses his balance and here comes the ball up in the air and guess who s going to,0
recover this fumble not number 52 it s not kirby kirby dropped it watch number 12 terry bradshaw quarterbacks are so versatile you would say,0

"Back in action, he breaks free but gets chased down! Billy Baird tackles him. That's Mattes' longest run this season!",1

""And there goes Matte, powering through the field for his longest run yet! Looks like Ressler's pulling to keep up.""",1

""Baltimore's Matte, the game's top ground gainer, takes a breather after a long run resulting in a first down on the Jet 16.""",1

As we approach halftime, the New York team is up and making moves. Atkinson's under-the-play stop just shy of the 15 yard line, carried by Hill.",1
"

Two linebackers, the middle linebacker and Larry Grantham, number 60, stand at the New York 15-yard line on second down, 9.",1
"

Defensive units of both teams show contrasting styles. Jets stick to the basics while the opponents use shifting and moving linebackers and lines.",1
"

""Either team can make big plays, but complex defensive strategies like a safety red dog are seldom seen. Baltimore's second down and 9 on the Jet's 15 and Morrall's slant pass is intercepted!""",1

Richardson with the deadly cut inside, leaving his opponent in the dust. And there he goes, catching the ball - an impressive display of skill!",1
"Number 62, Al Atkinson, coaching that player on getting up and running after that hit. That's the key in this game.",1
"""And the Jets have a challenging starting position at their own 2-yard line! As Al and Kyle noted, Baltimore has successfully advanced to a first down.""",1

""Blitz heavy and behind, they're pushing to get to Namath, but he's reading them like a book. Let's see...""",1
"Possible rephrased sentence: ""Baltimore going for the blitz, Jets trapped near their end zone! Super Bowl action goes on, what's the score?""",1
"""New York Jets lead 7-0 against Baltimore Colts as left cornerback Bobby Boyd temporarily left the field before returning to the bench.""",1
"""And he communicates a possible defensive strategy change to his squad. Jets hold a lead with 2 minutes left at their 2-yard line.""",1
"""Midway through, Snell rushes to the 3-4 yard mark, taken down by Shinnick at 66 and Gaubatz at 53. And that's all!""",1
"

""And there goes Boyd giving a word of advice to his teammates, reminding them not to execute the Reddogging safety play in this area!""",1
"Namath's analysis is spot on, but adding the red dogs could compromise the team's defense.",1
"

""Red dogs showing presence as the Jets face 2nd down with 8 yards to go on their 4-yard line. 1 minute and 25 seconds remaining in the first half.""",1
"""Namath's in no rush, signaling for a run by Snell who pushes forward to the 6 or 7 before being stopped by the opposing team's Billy.""",1
"Arkansas' left tackle, Ray Smith, slams him hard. He's got a decade of experience as Billy Ray Smith has 10 and 12 years under his belt.",1

Baltimore avoids a shutout with touchdowns by Braase and Miller. The NFL's seasoned expertise is evident compared to the fresher league.",1
"15 games in one season, an impressive feat accomplished only by this pro team, dominated the first half of every game this year.",1
"game, this team was the only NFL contender. However, they currently trail by 70 with only 1:12 left, and Boozer heads to the sideline.",1

""Get ready for an electrifying game as we return to Jacksonville on January 19th, where last year's match was a nail-biter, and this year promises to be no different!""",1
"

Tim Brown has taken the field to punt. Johnson has already scored twice with an average of 38 yards, but the wind might affect this one.",1
Possibly why the Jets couldn't catch that punt earlier - the wind is playing a role here.,1
"""And with a gusty wind, Timmy Brown sets up to field! The wind is still challenging, he'll need to exercise caution.""",1

""And Baltimore's bringing the heat with a 10-man front! He's in trouble, but somehow, he manages to get it away!""",1

""Tim Brown with a great kick, blocking for the punt returner. Brown's now at the Jet 46, using up some valuable time.""",1
He gets wrapped up at the Jet 42! The clock pauses at the 45-second mark of the first half. Johnson managed to release the ball.,1
"

""An excellent pressure kick! Baltimore couldn't capitalize as they were under pressure and couldn't find their way through.""",1

"Former Alabama center, a Bear Bryant All-American, ticking down 25 seconds to halftime. Number 45, Jerry Hill, pouncing into action.",1
"And it looks like Baltimore's fullback is calling for a timeout, stopping the clock with only 25 seconds left. Smart move by Curt!",1
"Colts remain cautious, keeping a deep defense to avoid getting scored on. A powerful triple to the left side showcases their strength.",1

""And it's the Colts with a heavy left flank, executing a triple play with Mackey and Matte, plus number 41, in position.""",1
"""Matte, number 41, into the slot, followed by wide receiver Jimmy Orr taking his position, making for a potent offensive setup.""",1

""Number 87 positions himself on the weak side of the field, possibly for the New York Jets. Let's see where he ends up playing!""",1
"""Here comes Willie Richardson, folks! And Earl Morrall is passing on his insights to Don Shula. Let's see how this plays out!""",1

"Baltimore gains 6 first downs, twice penetrating into Jets' side. New York, with 10 first downs, leads in the game.",1

Stopped in New York territory, a missed field goal looms as the Ravens secure only 93 rushing yards.",1

""58-yard field goal and 93-yard rushing by Baltimore, but the Jets hold the record for most rushing yards in a single play with 66.""",1

Orr with a golden opportunity at the 10-yard line! Wide open with no defenders in sight within 15 yards. Will he take advantage?",1
"""Kyle with a clear path to the 10-yard line! No one within 15 yards of him, he's unbelievably open! It's almost like nobody was there!""",1

"

""Today's game, are they on fire or what? And as for the Jets, I heard you're rooting for Baltimore.""",1

""Looks like a team mix-up for the Jets. Did they skip the papers? Ha ha ha, what a blunder!""",1

""Ohio guys are playing tough, but Snell is shining as a star. Ohio is matching the competition, you know.""",1
"""We've got a player on the field who's really making an impact. And let me tell you, those Ohio State boys are tough!""",1

"As we head into the second half, we're greeted with 70-degree heat, gusty winds, and darkening skies with the stadium lights beaming brightly. Let's go!",1
"

Brown with a high kick, takes it to the goal line, dashes five, ten, fifteen! But he's tackled by Rademacher at own 25!",1
"""And there it is folks, Smolinski with the first-half stats. Jets have the lead with 10 first downs to Baltimore's 6 and 92 rushing yards!""",1

""Looks like Unitas could make an appearance in the second half. Jets on first down with 11 to Baltimore's 6.""",1

Buck passes to Boozer, but he's stopped by Baltimore's left linebacker Mike Curtis and right end Ordell Braase, especially by Curtis (#32).",1

""Snell with a fierce hit on Boyd, but Curtis retaliates by bringing Snell down at the 14-yard line from behind!""",1
"

""The ball's on the 14, third down, 2 to go for the Jets. Here comes Namath, folks!""",1

"""Bubba Smith, with a track record of just two losses in four years, is going to be showcased here in slow-motion, Curt.""",1
"Herman's got some solid positioning here, just as Bubba mentioned earlier. Look at him go, taking hits and trying to push his opponent out.",1
"

And it looks like the drop of Namath is what set up that great play for number 78, Bubba Smith. Unfortunately, it results in an 8-yard loss.",1
And Winston Hill's not happy with the Baltimore boys. He's shoving them around after the play. It's getting heated out there!,1
"It's third and twenty-four and Namath has been sacked twice already, once in the first half and again early in the second.",1

Jets recover fumble at Baltimore 33 and make progress to the 11. But they're now pushed back to the Baltimore 25.",1

""Beautiful pass! Jerry Logan finds himself in the open field with nothing but green ahead of him!""",1

""Look at Logan's positioning on the field, it reveals the complexity of the defensive secondary play. That couple was no match.""",1
"

Baltimore's defense is utilizing a safety-heavy zone coverage, with the safeties primarily focused on short passes.",1

The Jets stuck in man-to-man coverage, and it seems Curt excels in that scheme by taking command.",1
"

""Mackey's position seems deep, will he go for it? Safety is out, crossing behind with Tom Matte could be the option.""",1

Morrall has a 5 out of 16 record and it's second down with 10 yards to go on Baltimore's 26-yard line. Possibly Jimmy Orr aiming for a better result.",1
"Namath's passes have been picked off but he remains interception-free. Hill gets the handoff, but Grantham puts him down. Regular set up.",1

""Number 62 Glenn Ressler, the Colts left guard, was in great position for a potentially damaging block!""",1

The Steelers love a good defensive blitz, great news for their quarterback in this game!",1
"

He's scanning the field for his receivers, looking for his open man. But his opponents have tight coverage, leaving no gaps for an easy throw.",1
"With little time to throw, the quarterback was under pressure and couldn't find his targets, resulting in a panicked toss.",1
"Don Meredith, once of the Dallas Cowboys, joins Howard Cosell for prime-time NFL coverage. Excellent job to both.",1
"

""Giants vs Steelers, Bradshaw fires a bullet for the first down! Shanklin, number 25, moving the chains. Third down and eight, yeah!""",1
"Catch made and tackled by number 20, jump for the first down. Ball now at the 49 yard line.",1
"As the first quarter winds down, Carrie Bradshaw, a 6'3"" 215-pound force, leads his team up to the line.",1
End of Q1 with the sound of the gun and the line of scrimmage set.,1
"

""We're live from Three Rivers Stadium where the Pittsburgh Steelers dominate the New York Giants, 7-0. These are NFL warriors!""",1
"

And they're facing a challenging industry where they demand attention and empathy without seeking it.",1
"

United Airlines is the go-to choice for NFL teams, with 24 out of 26 teams opting to fly with them. This is because they take great care of their passengers.",1
"With Fran Tarkenton as their starting QB, they're in good hands. You're in good hands with us, too. Bet on it.",1
"

The Giants' roster won't include him tonight. As he shared earlier with Howard Cosell, he's unavailable for this game.",1
"""Shiner is set to lead the Giants tonight, with word he's okay to play after his leg injury before kickoff.""",1
"

""And here comes young Terry Bradshaw leading the Pittsburgh Steelers from the giant 48 yard line. Keep an eye on Pearson, will he make the move?""",1
"

""Absolute dominance from Williams! He's made it down to the Steelers' 40-yard line in NY territory, causing terror among the opposing team.""",1
"

Grambling with the textbook tackle! Perfect execution of the game plan, as mentioned by Don Meredith. Earlier, we spoke to Bradshaw about this strategy.",1
"

""We've got a live update here folks, this morning he switched to the Blackbaud drill and confidently predicted the Steelers will run all over the Giants."" (24 words)",1
Meredith notes that the Jets' successful ground game from last week's game against the Giants is playing out just as Bradshaw predicted.,1
"

And there he is, folks, picturised and growing up in the past patterns. This will work for Howard on second down.",1
"

""And here we have Pittsburgh up against New York, at the 40-yard line. The Steelers are leading 7-0, with Pearson making more ground. Bob Demarco, the center, joins in to help paint it black and yellow with number 51!""",1
"

Pittsburgh's got the ball, but the missed block by West means he's changing directions with a leaf on it. Don't blame him!",1
"Swinging the ball with great force, he loses balance and sends the ball flying. It's anyone's guess who will grab it now.",1
"""The fumble recovery is not by Kirby, number 52 misses it. Keep your eyes on quarterback Terry Bradshaw, an athlete with tremendous versatility on the field.""",1
"

""Bradshaw emerges from the scrum as Fitchburg faces third down at the Giant 41-yard line.""",1
"

""And he's through the middle, 1st down! Lockhart out of nowhere with a solid tackle. 1st down Steelers!""",1
"

""Steelers up 7-0 in the second, ball on New York's 37. Bradshaw's pass is nearly caught, but Willie breaks it up!""",1
Superb defense from Williams! He reached around and swatted the ball away just as it was about to be caught.,1
"

Hubie Bryan, number 32, the intended receiver. 12:30 left in the first half. The Birds have possession on New York's 37-yard line, 2nd and 10.",1
"

""Bradshaw's setting up a flat pattern, keep an eye on that. Looking, going deep and bingo! Touchdown!""",1
"

And Franklin, the North Texas boy, skillfully slips that ball back into his pocket. That was absolutely perfect, folks!",1
"On the screen, he pointed out, ""I like a guy who shows a little emotion."" It's always good to see passion in sports.",1
"

Bradshaw takes the ball and runs down the field with Smith on his tail, but Jean Mingo seals the deal with a successful conversion.",1
"And there it is folks, Pittsburgh Steelers' second touchdown! Terry with the 37-yard pass and Shanklin heads to the sidelines.",1
"""And it's Bradshaw on Monday Night NFL Football this fall on ABC, calling a time-out! The Pittsburgh Steelers struggling with that nega persona, but it looks like they're starting something. And, baby, just look at that face!""",1
"""And the baby face shave, exclusively from Persona, makes a huge statement! All you need for a successful fishing trip is Miller High Life!""",1
"""Life's on his side, and a bit of luck too! Check out that amazing performance by Big Dad! Time for a Miller party with the robust and deep flavors of Miller High!""",1
"""And here we go, folks! Alan Watson, with the champagne of beers, is set to kick off for the Pittsburgh Steelers as they march 91 yards in 11 impressive plays to score!""",1
"

Bradshaw launches his first touchdown pass! Deep kick into the end zone, Giants will return.",1
"""First and ten at the 20-yard line, 12:20 left in the first half. Steelers currently leading and the ball is still in play!""",1
"""14-0, and it's Dick Shiner's turn. Number 11 sets up the Pittsburgh Steelers, but watch out! Mean Joe Green steps in with an incredible defensive play. Number 75, there's me!""",1
"


""And here we have it, folks- the stats on these guys are off the charts! Lightning-fast with absolutely outstanding nimbleness and grace. They're the real deal!""",1
"

""That's a hefty Charger at 270 pounds, but Don Meredith says when you're that big, you can play rough. What a Texan!""",1
"Destiny needs to step up as he's back on 2nd and 20, going for the middle, but Dr. Frederickson is not giving much room.",1
"

""24 with the ball, advances to the 12-yard line, but Green quickly halts the action. Looks like someone's been woken up!""",1
"

""And here we go folks, it's third down and 18 yards to go for the Giants. The ball is just beyond the 12 yard line, and Dick Shiner steps back to throw.""",1
"If Ron Johnson's supporters want to win, Steelers' defense needs to step up. Giants will be forced to punt.",1
"""Rocky Bleier at the goal line with number 32 Hubie Bryant. Bill Johnson, the Giants' putter, averaging low.""",1
"

""Stellar left-footed kick for over 40 yards, Rocky Bleier makes a fair catch, Steelers gain a sensational first down against New York!""",1
"""At the 48 yard line, it's Monday night pro football action brought to you by the NFL and ABC. Score update: Pittsburgh calls a timeout.""",1
"""Steelers lead 14-0 against the Giants and now Esso introduces a game-changing gasoline, the Big Plus - live broadcast at the stadium!""",1
"""And the gasoline's got a lot of pluses folks, low and with a dash of led left in it. Let's see how this plays out on the track.""",1
"

""And here we have the cars cruising on the track with no valve damage! To cut auto air pollution, we've increased carburetor cleaner usage twofold and maintained the speed.""",1
"And just like that, the octane levels have gone up, allowing the majority of modern drivers to fuel up worry-free with Big Plus!",1
"

""And there goes the big plus of S a price! Cheaper than the competition, but don't forget the ultimate advantage - the lid!""",1
"""Here we have an impressive move from the team, opting for Big Plus gasoline - not only reducing emissions, but also maximizing power with high octane and minimum lead. And they top it all off with growing onions on the side!""",1
"

""And we've got the new quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, number five Gerry Hanratty, fresh out of Notre Dame, ready to show us what he's made of!""",1
"

""Keith, surprise move from Han as he enters the game sooner than expected. Bradshaw's double must have pushed for this takeover.""",1
"

""And it looks like Terry is being sent in by Pittsburgh. They're turning him loose to make things happen. John 48 Pearson still standing in the game.""",1
"

""And he's still pushing! The ball's at the 48 and he's down at the 43 for a gain of five. Brenner with the tackle, but he's not letting up!""",1
"""Ready for the game against Pittsburgh, folks? Bradshaw's size and chemistry with Hanratty were discussed this morning. He kept it real - honesty is key!""",1
"No fights yet, but it's tough to extend the olive branch when you're battling for a win. Can they put aside their differences?",1
"

""The offense committed a penalty against the Steelers, giving them a first down in 2003. Bankston coughed up the ball upon contact.""",1
"And there goes the helmet! They've been locking those tackles and ends down all game. Check it out, just impressive.",1
"

""Men in the center of the Giants defense holding strong. Number 75 almost spun out but recovers.""",1
"

A tremendous push up the center by Pittsburgh's offensive line! Van Dyck with some solid play there. What an effort!",1
Davis of Pittsburgh's offensive line advances to Stinger's 47-yard line. Second down with 14 yards to go. Watch out for Bengston and Lockhart in the secondary.,1
"

He gets it behind the line! Goes for the reverse! But he didn't hold his ground long enough! Mistake!",1
"

He pulls off a fake, quickly shifting left and leaving the defense scrambling. The DBs and LBs need to keep their eyes peeled.",1
"

Backfield's miscoordination causes a dire situation. The lost yardage takes them back to the 44, making it third down.",1
"

""Hanratty pulls him down at around 18 yards, assisted by Tulane's number 46. Steelers need to speed up now!""",1
Lockhart Spyder making a move into his assumed position on the line. Keep your eyes locked on the screen for more!,1
"

""Maximum bliss! That blitz was déjà vu from earlier. The defense locked their deadlifts and then Hen Reddy came with the audible, but couldn't connect.""",1
"

""Clock's ticking and no sign of a blitz. Tight end Denis Shoes (No. 82) enters the game.""",1
Georgia facing a tough third down with 23 yards to go. Hanratty's struggle for the top job won't be helped by this play.,1
"""What a play! Seema and Shay with a great pass rush, making the tackle. They're getting paid to do just that.""",1
"

""And the Pittsburgh Steelers kick off! It's Bobby Walden, the veteran from Georgia. What a beauty! Miller fumbles, and there's Walden on the side, 24!""",1
"

And he drops the ball! It went right through his arms. No excuse for that. He's got to follow it back there.",1
"

""And he's got the ball! Look at the guy who tackled him, not sure who it was, but he's bringing his A-game.""",1
Miller could've regretted his drop as Pittsburgh leads 14-0 against the New York Giants at Three Rivers Stadium.,1
"

""Before we continue folks, Pittsburgh has a new Pinto that bids adieu to frequent maintenance. Say goodbye to those tiresome repairs with Pinto!""",1
"""And there goes the car, folks! With half the oil change frequency of the competition, Padrone is leaving them behind. Its lightweight chassis causes low drag and easy maintenance. Even the spark plugs can be swapped without hassle!""",1
"""And there it goes, folks! This Pinto is averaging over 25 miles to the gallon and has self-adjusting brakes! Say goodbye to simulated city and suburban driving!""",1
"""The Pinto's paint stays shining without wax, thanks to its zinc-plated underbody parts. No rust here, say goodbye to imports!""",1
"

""And there goes Pinto, followed by Goodbye, leaving behind a lot of extra servicing. But Kundo, the little carefree car, is about to get a big upgrade from Ford on September 11. Stay tuned!""",1
"

""Fran, we're 10 minutes in and it looks like Dick Shiner is having trouble with his signals. What's going on down there on the sidelines?""",1
"""It's clear that Farwell needs to establish a running game. Howard is poised to make it happen, let's see if he can pull it off.""",1

China on the 24-yard line, Ron Johnson gains a first down crossing the 39-yard mark of New York's territory!",1
"

And there goes Clarence Oliver with a game-changing tackle for Pittsburgh! Eight minutes and 24 seconds left in the first half, with the Students leading the Knicks 14-0!",1
"

""China, formerly of the Steelers, now backing up the Giants, as they take over first and ten at their own 39-yard line.""",1
"

Pass goes to Ron Johnson, but oh no, Johnson drops it! Fran Tarkenton, why aren't they using the wide running game?",1
"

""And here comes the team heading towards the short sideline, opting for hitches to strengthen their running game. Howard predicts a full role for them in a week.""",1
"He's scanning the zone, eyeing his seams to break through against the opposing team. His go-to move will be to thrust the ball with precision!",1
"

""Here comes the back, eyeing Johnson with lightning speed! But wait, Veronica shakes the tackle! He's making his way 10 to 12 yards!""",1
"

""And here we have Johnson at Medfield, a rookie, tackled by Mel Blount. Second down and ten, 39-yard line with 15 yards from those little hitch passes by New York.""",1
"

""And here we go, folks. Southern New York with the ball at midfield, first and ten. Tucker Fredrickson takes it down to the Pittsburgh 2034, stopping at the 35 yard line!""",1

Giants set for another first down, clock ticking at 7:20 in the first half. Shining performance with 5 out of 10 pass completion.",1
"""Steelers dominate with 10 passes for 455 yards, leading 14-0 at end of Q1. In another preseason game, Washington leads Buffalo.""",1

""The Giants lead 3-0 and they're changing their formation as Burton and Johnson go in as the set backs, and here comes the throw by China!""",1
"

""Dyslexic pass, meant for Clifton McNeil #18, intercepted by linebacker Chuck Allen - traded to Steelers.""",1
"

San Diego's defender denies the pass. Second and ten for New York, moving up to Pittsburgh's 35-yard line. Frederickson with a successful screen, earning the first down.",1
"

""Tucker Fredrickson, known for his injury struggles, tackled by Chuck Berry at the 20-yard line - impressive performance tonight.""",1
"And we have a substitution for the Pittsburgh Steelers as McGee takes the field to play defense, replacing Greenwood. A fresh look for the newly built Three Rivers Stadium!",1
"

""And here we go folks, the first football match in this spanking new stadium. Ron Johnson flexing his muscle but a crushing tackle by number 71 from Pittsburgh results in a big loss of two yards.""",1
"

""Here at halftime, we've got Dick Aren't, a 65-year veteran from Idaho. Washington Redskins lead Buffalo 20-0, 2nd down with 12 yards to go at their own 22-yard line.""",1
"

""Big Shiner from the Giants sends it deep to Clifton McNeill, who couldn't quite hold onto the ball despite strong defending.""",1
"

""And here we go, folks! It's third down with about ten to twelve yards to go. Pittsburgh's Oliver Francis with the clearance, and yes, they're going to run it!""",1
"

""Rose not doing as well against their defense, but expected. Moving strong side with no surprises from opponents.""",1
"

Week Roll making big moves, but Dix is putting on the pressure with a solid pass rush. Short passes seem to be the way to go.",1
"

""And here we have a crucial moment, folks! The team needs to utilize the screen pass and get the ball moving down the field. Let's see what they come up with on this 3rd and 12.""",1
"Giants with good field position at the Steelers' 22-yard line, but the pass, intended for Freeman, falls incomplete. Tough break for the Giants.",1
"

""It looks like Dick was stretching for that route. The pass was too high. That kind of situation won't work.""",1
"

""And here we have a third and ten, maybe twelve - looks like they're going for it! They'll often go for the score in this situation.""",1

""And here comes the run post! It's crucial for the outside receivers to make their move and cut across the middle for a one-on-one battle!""",1

We're looking at a potential penalty here as the Pittsburgh Steelers are being called out for defensive holding on this pass play.",1

And he throws the pigskin forward, down to the 17 yard line for a crucial first down, a move more vital than just gaining five yards.",1

""Fiction's Giants on Pittsburg's 17-yard line, 5 mins 8 secs till first half, it's a tight moment as he gets ready to throw.""",1
"Number 71 from Pittsburgh shoots! It's a desperate attempt by the underdog, but Dick Aren't Big, weighing in at 265 pounds, is going to try to explain ASAP!",1
